then they feel controlled and there is a sense of resignation. They need encouragement to get moving to find a way to create a solution - to feel they have 'permission' or are capable.

When child energy is in same energy - means Adult and child are both in house of 5, i.e. 2.2.5, 3.3.5 - these people can appear arrogant, stubborn, they don't experience any shift from child to adult energy as it's the same. They carry on feeling the same. Childhood patterns are carried forward. Strengths are their weaknesses - they can have self doubt and overdo things. Lot of energy when balanced. Tend towards hypoglycaemic. Psychoactives are particularly injurious.

Child energy in house that has same element but different number - 3.4, 5.2, 7.6

This creates a sensation of wholeness. Yin and yang version of same energy. Relaxed demeanour, good at handling stress. More adaptable to stress / things being not ideal.
