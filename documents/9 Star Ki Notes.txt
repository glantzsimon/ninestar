In a 5 earth year, there is more conflict because every person is in their own number - and so we are more 'differentiated' and this heightens and highlights our differences, leading to greater friction

Internally, individuals also have a system of parts, these parts are more differentiated when we are in a 5 year (year of birth yang) and this causes more internal conflict and greater awareness of systemic imbalances

If the child number house is the controlling (i.e. metal child in wood house) - the opposite of ko cycle dynamic happens. The Controlling element is controlled!! This ledas to rebelliousness or an explosive tendency in the child under stress. Feling trapped and a constant urge to assert themselves. This causes disproportionate reactions to stress.

-

When child energy is in house that controls it (1 energy in metal hosue)
then they feel controlled and there is a sense of resignation. They need encouragement to get moving to find a way to create a solution - to feel they have 'permission' or are capable.

- 

When child energy is in same energy - means Adult and child are both in house of 5, i.e. 2.2.5, 3.3.5 - these people can appear arrogant, stubborn, they don't experience any shift from child to adult energy as it's the same. They carry on feeling the same. Childhood patterns are carried forward. Strengths are their weaknesses - they can have self doubt and overdo things. Lot of energy when balanced. Tend towards hypoglycaemic. Psychoactives are particularly injurious.

-

Child energy in house that has same element but different number - 3.4, 5.2, 7.6

This creates a sensation of wholeness. Yin and yang version of same energy. Relaxed demeanour, good at handling stress. More adaptable to stress / things being not ideal.
