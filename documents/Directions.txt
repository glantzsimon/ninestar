4 Dangerous Directions

In the direction of number 5 Go O Satsu "Five Yellow Killing"

Travelling in this direction will tend to bring some obvious difficulty or misfortune, such as an accident, sickness, financial difficulty, failure, etc.

-------------

In opposite direction of number 5 - An Ken Satsu "Dark Sword Killing"

This is more subtle than "Go O Satsu". Travelling in this direction tends to bring unexpected kinds of misfortune, hence the image of a sword coming at you in the darkness.

-------------

In the direction of your own number "Hon Mei Satsu" "Self Life Killing"

-------------

In the opposite direction of your own number "Teki Satsu" - Target Killing

-------------

Check year and month. If year or month is ok, it's ok. If both are not, try to take a companion or split the trip to avoid the bad direction. Trips shorter than 2 weeks should be ok. Eat well, take plenty of rest.

Update:

Yin / Yang inversion

Yin / Yang inversion for yearl and monthly energies

Directionality / magic square and numbers 1 - 9 and their seasons

Caution not in opposite years, but in same year!!! As we move more into imbalance. THis is the exact opposite of traditional advice

Write about 9 and 81 years cycles and yearly and monthly and how they affect the planet
