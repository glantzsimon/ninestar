Every 81 years, the earth's atmosphere assumes a certain pattern of
movement that corresponds to one of the nine numbers and stages of
energy. As it does in the yearly and monthly cycles, the energy in this larger
cycle moves downward from 9 to 1. The 81-year cycle gives a certain
character to a span of time that lasts for several generations.
The current 81-year cycle began in 1955 and will last until2036. During
this period, the number 9 occupies the center of the chart. We are currently
in an 81-year epoch that has the characteristics of a Nine Purple Fire Year,
during which the general movement of society tends to reflect the rapidly
expanding and diffusing tendency of fire nature.
This high energy period is governed by strong centrifugal force, and until it
ends, many of the institutions and ways of thinking established during the
previous cycle will collapse.
