    This year represents night and winter. It's cold, dark and still. The seed is still in the ground. 
</h5>
<p>
    This is a time for hibernation, deep rest and reflection. A time for pondering what one wishes to create during the next 9 year cycle.
</p>
<p>
    During this year, it is common to feel withdrawn and uncommunicative. Others may appear to keep their distance and we may feel vulnerable, hypersensitive and even fearful at times. It's a bit like when we are asleep and we need to make sure we are in a safe place and protected.
</p>
<p>
    It is also not uncommon for our health to be more vulnerable during a Water year. We need to make sure we take plenty of rest and that we tend to the needs of our body.
</p>
<p>
    It can also feel as though all of our dreams are out of reach and that we are stagnating in life. However, it is also the time when our intuition is at its strongest. This can help us to tune in and see the bigger picture, which can guide us in charting our plans for the next cycle of growth.
</p>
<p>
    This is not the most auspicious time for starting new projects and endeavors, as misunderstandings and obstacles may arise. Instead, it is a time for dreaming, slowing down, resting, and recharging one's energy. Ideas and inspiration come when we are still.
</p>
<p>
    This is also an excellent time for developing our spiritual nature. Meditation, yoga and other similar practises are immensely helpful during this time.

    Fire and Earth Energies are most likely to feel discomfort when they occupy this House, as their Energies are in a Challenging Transformation with the Water element.

    The Water element in Chinese medicine is associated with the health of the urinary and reproductive systems, such as the bladder, kidneys, adrenals glands, etc. During this year, these organs recharge themselves. This is another reason why it is especially important to get adequate rest during this time. It is advised to avoid cold and damp environments and foods. It is more nourishing to eat warming, salty and lightly spiced foods.

This is the house of winter and the north. It is a dark period where there is little movement on the surface. Caution is needed during these times and excessive activity can result in accidents and rapid dissipation of energy. When visiting this house, it is best to be quiet and reflective. Meditation, time for personal reflection, research into the deeper matters of life, will create a stronger knowledge base from which to act. Finances may be difficult at these times and one must be conservative with outlays. This is not a time to be innovative. Wait until you move out of this house before embarking on new ideas and ventures. There may be unexpected expenses.

On a personal level, you may find that friends and associates appear to keep their distance. This is because, when you are experiencing the House of One, you are less expressive, probably more enigmatic, and thus leave people feeling somewhat uncertain of their relationship to you. There is nevertheless a strong intuitive sense operating at these times, and thus the nuances of relationships are seen more clearly. If stress arises, this intuition may become hypersensitivity, in which case a person in this house may develop some fear, even paranoia, about getting close to others.

Illnesses that have to do with fluids of the body — blood, lymph, water, semen — and their associated organs should be guarded against with appropriate preventive measures. It is also best to be wary of hazards from liquids in the environment, like poor-quality water, overconsumption of alcohol, floods or toxic waste. The numbers 9, 2 and 5 should be particularly mindful at these times.
