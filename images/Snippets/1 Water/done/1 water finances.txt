Financially, a one-water has neither excessively good nor excessively bad fortune. They donâ€™t amass much wealth personally, but they get by. In a business context, especially, where risks are involved and the competition is slick, it is best not to have a one-water involved in transactions as they can easily be swindled. They have a tendency to be impressed by big displays of power and money. This is especially true if the person they are negotiating with is of the opposite sex. At the same time, where resources other than money are involved, their cautiousness allows them to apportion those resources so as to sustain them in the long term. They are generally conscious of their own limitations.
