One-water people must learn to take care of their bladder-kidney energy, along with associated tissues, structures and functions, like the skeletal structure and the reproductive system (see profile). Such people are more prone to problems with sexual organs. Women may have gynaecological difficulties, irregular menses, etc., while men may have prostate problems, and possibly impotence at times.

These are people who need to take care not to get too cold. Adequate warmth around the stomach, middle and lower back and ears is recommended. Such people need to keep good-quality water and salt as basics in their food preparation. Salt-covered snacks and the salting of foods at the table are not recommended. Nor should food be too hot or too cold. Macrobiotic food preparation and observances should be investigated.

Because of their sensitivity, one-water people are prone to nervous irritation, which usually expresses itself as fear, even paranoia when under extreme duress. A stressed one-water may express a timidity that makes them immobile or rigid, like ice. This can, in turn, have negative effects on all the physiological aspects mentioned earlier. Progressive relaxation can be useful to this person, as is soothing asynchronous music which allows the mind to settle. A one-water would also benefit from right and left brain exercises. Such practices and observances are useful to the one-water over their lifetime as unbridled tension and stress may lead them to become senile in later years.

Exercise should be aimed at keeping the skeletal system flexible, especially the spine. Yoga would be an excellent choice as would swimming, preferably in salt water or pools that use ozone or oyster shell for purification rather than chlorine.
