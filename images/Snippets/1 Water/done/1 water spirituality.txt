Because of their deep-thinking nature, it is meaning that plays a central role in the one-water’s spiritual life. Life’s events come fast and furious to them and it is a challenge in their life to learn and let go, almost simultaneously.

To be present and relax into the moment as it is, a one-water needs to go through a baptism or purification process — to clean things up and not hold on. Humour is an attribute to cultivate as it is too easy for one-waters to find themselves being too serious about the significance of things and holding on to matters and issues in their life unnecessarily. As they let go more and ‘go with the flow’, their insights become easier to communicate.

One-water people, because of their depth and sensitivity, have an innate sense of the human condition. Although they can appear condescending to others, much of this behaviour comes from almost caring too much for people. With more detachment, this way of being can be transformed into an active compassion, and will be like soothing waters for those to whom they turn their attention.

Relaxation and silent meditation are helpful. Having bowls of water on a shrine or altar is grounding, also the use of sound, especially crystal bowls or chimes. Meditation on compassion should be emphasized. As sexuality can be an important factor in spiritual development, one-waters who have practised various purifications and spiritual disciplines may wish to investigate the Tao of Love or consult an authentic master regarding tantric sexual practice.
