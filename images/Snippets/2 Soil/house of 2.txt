This is a time when not much of significance happens, and any efforts to make things happen will usually result in negative outcomes and reactions from others. You can stick to the mundane with moderate success at such times. However, with greater plans or ideas, you should accumulate rather than initiate. You can accumulate money, resources, allies, etc. in preparation for a new venture, but donâ€™t start just yet.

Beware of excessive banter and boasting about what you can do. During this time people occupying this house may appear uncharacteristically superficial. This could put off needed allies.

On an emotional level, a person whose natal numbers are in this house may experience a general state of worry that pervades many areas of their life. They may also find themselves over-involved in the concerns of others. As regards health, physical problems with lymphatics and other aspects of the earth element need to be guarded against. People with natal numbers 1, 3 and 4 should be generally more conscious of these effects when in the House of Two.
