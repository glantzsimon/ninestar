This house possesses the power and energy of spring. Ideas come flooding in and with them the energy to begin undertakings of grand proportions. In this house, people find their creativity stimulated. However, there can be an accompanying lack of groundedness. Because the mind is so active, small but necessary details in projects may be overlooked. Consequently, although great things are possible, so are dismal failures.

When a personâ€™s natal numbers visit this house, there is a desire to get on and do things. If stifled or thwarted, frustration may ensue with a greater likelihood of outbursts of anger. Even the calmest person may find themselves breaking out at this time, and vocal expression tends to be louder and more direct than usual. Physical activity and expression increase.

Because of this increased expression, there may be an imbalance involving the nervous system and tree/space-related organs and tissues (such as the liver, gall bladder, muscles and connective tissue) if preventive measures are not taken. You should remain physically active, watch your consumption of oil, flour products and animal food, and guard against exposure to easterly winds. Earth (2, 5, 8) and metal air (6, 7) people should be particularly mindful.
