This is a time when one sees tangible results in what one has previously initiated. Most affairs and dealings in your life will go smoothly. Because of this, you can focus more, become more contemplative, and act when the timing makes action appropriate. There is, however, the tree/space tendency towards impetuosity. You should guard against this as it is unnecessary and may, in fact, undermine possible accomplishments, rather like pulling a plant out of the ground to see how it is growing. Using the vision of tree/space energy, one can steer things in the best direction. Thus the formula for getting things done should be: look, think, then act.

Communication skills are enhanced at this time and the use of voice and media can be quite effective. Just donâ€™t lead people on.

There is a natural maturity of outlook here, and anything to the contrary has more to do with self-sabotage and confusion than with outside influences.

Imbalances that may arise during this time are paralysis and digestive and respiratory tract ailments. You should be mindful of the same aspects of lifestyle as mentioned in the description of the House of Three-Tree/Space, paying particular attention to keeping the throat and chest warm and away from draughts. Earth (2, 5, 8) and metal/air (6, 7) people are more susceptible to the imbalances inherent in this house.
