    The Day Star Ki, which is the influence of the daily Global Ki at the time of birth, carries a more surface-level influence compared to the deeper, more foundational energies of the yearly or monthly Ki in a person's birth chart. It influences the way we appear to the world—our outward expression, body language, tone, and style of communication. The Day Star colours our general mannerisms, emotional tone, and the first impression we tend to make on others, although to a slightly lesser extent.

    Understanding the Day Star can provide insight into how we are perceived in social contexts and how we tend to act when interacting casually with others.
