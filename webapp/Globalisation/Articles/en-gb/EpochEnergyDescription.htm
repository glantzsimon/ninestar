    The Epoch Ki is the Ki that was present during the 81-year period in which a person was born. Its influence is similar to the generational Ki, but is very broad, affecting multiple generations. The Epoch Ki is visible in the global themes of the period in question and its influence extends to broader areas of human endeavour and activity, such as politics, science, technology, education, philosophy, ethics, culture, economics, and spirituality, as well as trends in the arts, architecture, fashion, etc.
