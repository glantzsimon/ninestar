    The Generational Ki is the Ki that was present during the 9-year period in which a person was born. This is wider-reaching and has a less personal effect than the yearly or monthly Ki. Its influence is generally more visible in the behaviour and thinking of the generation or group. The influence of this energy can also be seen and felt in how a person or generation feels they can contribute to solving the problems of the era into which they were born and how that might shape career choices and projects with which they might get involved.

    While the yearly and monthly houses influence our more personal and immediate experiences, the Generational Ki speaks to deeper, longer-term themes: our life mission, the karmic patterns we’re here to work through, and the role we may play within the larger story of our generation.

    This energy shapes the overall spirit, values, and worldview of an entire generation and reveals their shared challenges and gifts — whether they are reformers, caretakers, visionaries, or rebuilders. On a personal level, this Ki can subtly guide us toward certain types of service, career paths, or collective movements. It helps us understand how we are meant to contribute to the healing or evolution of the time we were born into. While not as visibly active as the yearly or monthly cycles, the Generational Ki is deeply woven into the undercurrents of our personal growth, often emerging more clearly as we mature.
