    The Generational Ki is the Ki that was present during the 9-year period in which a person was born. This is wider-reaching and has a less personal effect than the yearly or monthly Ki. Its influence is generally more visible in the behaviour and thinking of the generation or group. The influence of this energy can also be seen and felt in how a person or generation feels they can contribute to solving the problems of the era into which they were born and how that might shape career choices and projects with which they might get involved. On an individual level, this energy has an impact on our longer-term goals, our life's mission and the karmic lessons we are here to learn.
