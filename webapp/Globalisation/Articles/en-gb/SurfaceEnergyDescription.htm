    In some ways, this Energy is similar to the Rising Sign in the Western Zodiac system, although it is not calculated from the same data. It describes <strong>how we appear to others</strong>, especially on <strong>first impression</strong>. It influences how we <strong>interact with others out in the world</strong> and our outward behaviours and mannerisms.
