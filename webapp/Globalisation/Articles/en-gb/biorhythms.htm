<h5>
    Biorhythms are biological rhythms of a fixed duration that influence our energy levels in multiple ways.

<p>
    There are many different biorhythms of different durations, each one influencing a particular faculty. For example, there are intellectual, emotional, physical, spiritual and many other, more subtle biorhythms. 9 Star Ki influeces us in similar ways. When you combine the information of biorhythms with 9 Star Ki cycles, you begin to get a very detailed picture about what is going on physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually. This can be a tremendous help when it comes to planning ahead, so that we can maximise our natural energies and use them in the most coherent way, which may also include knowing when to rest and replenish our energy.
