    When using the Personal Chart and Predictions calculators, there are three calculation methods to choose from:
</h5>

<p class="margin-bottom-0"><strong>Traditional Nine Star Ki</strong></p>
<p>Uses a Yang materialising spiral for both men's and women's personal charts.</p>

<p class="margin-bottom-0"><strong>Ascending Yin Ki For Personal Charts</strong></p>
<p>Uses a Yang materialising spiral for men's and a Yin ascending spiral for women's personal charts./p>

<p class="margin-bottom-0"><strong>Ascending Yin Ki For Personal Charts and Predictions</strong></p>
<p>Uses a Yang materialising spiral for men's and a Yin ascending spiral for both women's personal charts and predictions.</p>

<p class="margin-bottom-0"><strong>Traditional 9 Star Ki</strong></p>
<p>Traditionally, 9 Star Ki and Feng Shui practitioner use the <strong>Yang materialising spiral</strong> for all calculations, meaning that, as each year passes, the Ki descends, cycling from 9 - 1. According to most traditional 9 Star Ki and Feng Shui practitioners, this method works best.</p>

<p class="margin-bottom-0"><strong>The Chinese Method</strong></p>
<p>This method of calculation originated in China and was believed to be more accurate for women, who are typically more Yin and therefore more affected by the Yin spiral. This subject is a delicate one and can be a bone of contention in Macrobiotic circles; however, a number of 9 Star Ki practitioners today have also started to use the <strong>Yin ascending spiral</strong> when calculating charts for female clients, and often find that it yields more accurate results. Whilst the Yang descending Ki has a materialising, condensing effect, the Yin ascending Ki is believed to have a more spiritualising and expansive one.</p>

<p class="margin-bottom-0"><strong>Yin / Yang Ki and Precession</strong></p>
<p>
    In reality, both Yin and Yang spirals are always present and in effect; however, the Yang materialising spiral is more dominant during the winter season of the Great Year. We are now well into the spring season of the Great Year and as we move out of Precessional Winter (or 'Kali Yuga', as the yogis like to call it), the influence of the Yin ascending spiral is increasingly being felt, especially by those who are either more sensitive by nature or who are more spiritually inclined. This is especially noticeable in younger generations.

<p class="margin-bottom-0"><strong>The Golden Age</strong></p>
<p>
    As we progress towards the summer season of the Great Year, the influence of the Yin ascending spiral will continue to increase, whilst the Yang materialising spiral will decrease in its effects. By the year 2104, all of humanity will be predominantly affected by the Yin ascending spiral. According to some sources, this is officially the beginning of The Golden Age. However, just as the dawn announces the day long before the sun rises over the horizon, so the transition of the ages is gradual. We encourage you to use your intuition and to pick the method that best fits your needs. This may well vary from person to person. At 9starkiastrology.com, we often compare both charts to see which feels intuitively a better fit. For practitioners, it can be useful to discuss this directly with clients.
