    When using the Personal Chart and Predictions calculators, there are two calculation methods to choose from:
</h5>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p class="margin-bottom-0"><strong>Traditional Nine Star Ki</strong></p>
        <p>Uses a Yang materialising spiral for both men's and women's personal charts.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="margin-bottom-0"><strong>The Chinese Method (Ascending Yin Ki for Females)</strong></p>
        <p>Uses a Yang materialising spiral for men, and a Yin ascending spiral for women's charts and predictions.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p class="margin-bottom-0"><strong>Traditional 9 Star Ki</strong></p>
<p>Traditionally, 9 Star Ki and Feng Shui practitioners use the <strong>Yang materialising spiral</strong> for all calculations, meaning that as each year passes, the Ki descends, cycling from 9 to 1. Proponents of this method argue that it is more appropriate today because we are still in the material age, which affects both men and women alike.</p>

<p class="margin-bottom-0"><strong>The Chinese Method</strong></p>
<p>This method of calculation originated in China and was believed to be more accurate for women, who are typically more Yin and therefore believed to be more affected by the <strong>Yin ascending Ki</strong>. This subject is a delicate one and can be a bone of contention in Macrobiotic circles. However, a number of 9 Star Ki practitioners today have also started to use the Yin ascending spiral when calculating charts for female clients and often find that it yields more accurate results. While the Yang descending Ki has a materialising, condensing effect, the Yin ascending Ki is believed to have a more spiritualising and expansive one.</p>

<h5 class="margin-top-0">
    In addition to the two calculation methods, there is an optional parameter that determines which houses to display for cyclical predictions.
</h5>

<p class="margin-bottom-0"><strong>Houses Display Options</strong></p>
<p>In traditional 9 Star Ki, the yearly natal Ki, or 'Core Energy', is used to determine the houses occupied for periods of all lengths. We give you the option to display the houses occupied by the solar and lunar natal Ki, as well as the option to match the houses and predictions isometrically. For example, using the isometric option, we would use the house occupied by our natal yearly Ki for the yearly predictions, that of the monthly natal Ki for monthly predictions, daily natal Ki for daily predictions, and so on. We encourage you to explore this feature. The influence of Ki is essentially 'holographic,' and the energies combine in their influence over our lives in fascinating ways.</p>

<p class="margin-bottom-0"><strong>Yin / Yang Ki and Precession</strong></p>
<p>
    In reality, both Yin and Yang spirals are always present and in effect; however, the Yang materialising spiral is more dominant during the winter season of the Great Year. We are now well into the spring season of the Great Year, and as we move out of Precessional Winter (or 'Kali Yuga,' as the yogis like to call it), the influence of the Yin ascending spiral is increasingly being felt—especially by those who are either more sensitive by nature or more spiritually inclined. This is especially noticeable in younger generations.
</p>

<p class="margin-bottom-0"><strong>The Golden Age</strong></p>
<p>
    As we progress toward the summer season of the Great Year, the influence of the Yin ascending spiral will continue to increase, while the Yang materialising spiral will decrease in its effects. By the year 2104, all of humanity will be predominantly affected by the Yin ascending spiral. According to some sources, this is officially the beginning of the Golden Age. However, just as the dawn announces the day long before the sun rises over the horizon, so too is the transition of the ages gradual. We are already well into the precessional dawn, and the glow of its aurora is very much felt and seen.
</p>

<p class="margin-bottom-0"><strong>Which method should you use?</strong></p>
<p>
    We encourage you to use your intuition and to pick the method that best fits your needs. This may well be on a case-by-case basis. At 9starkiastrology.com, we often compare both charts to see which feels intuitively like a better fit. For practitioners, it can be useful to discuss this directly with clients. We have observed that the demographic and age of the person are important factors, as well as how spiritually or metaphysically inclined and sensitive they are. Generally speaking, the younger generations seem to be more influenced by the ascending Ki—which makes sense, as they've been less impacted by the more condensing Yang energies present further into our recent past.
