<p>Traditionally, 9 Star Ki and Feng Shui practitioner use the Yang materialising spiral for all calculations, meaning that as each year passes, the energy descends from 9 - 1. According to most traditional 9 Star Ki and Feng Shui practitioners, this method works best. This subject is a declicate and can be a bone of contention in Macrobiotic circles; however, a number of 9 Star Ki practitioners today have also started to use the Yin ascending spiral and often find that it yields more accurate results. </p>

    Whilst the Yang descending ki has a materialising, condensing effect, the Yin ascending ki is believed to have a more spiritualising and expansive one. Both cycles are always present; however, the Yang materialising spiral is more dominant during the winter season of the Great Year or the Precession of the Equinoxes. We are now well into the spring season of the Great Year and as we move out of Precessional Winter or 'Kali Yuga', as the yogis like to call it, the influence of the Yin ascending spiral is increasingly being felt, especially by those who are either more sensitive by nature or who are more spiritually inclinced. This is especially noticeable in younger generations.

<p>
    As we progress towards the summer season of the Great Year, the influence of the Yin ascending spiral will continue to increase, whilst the Yang materialising spiral will descrease in its effects. By the year 2014, all of humanity will be predominantly affected by Yin ascending spiral. This is officially the beginning of The Golden Age. However, just as the dawn announces the day long before the sun rises over the horizon, so the transition of the ages is gradual. We encourage you to use your intuition and pick the method that best fits your needs. This may well vary from person to person. At 9starkiastrology.com, we often compare both charts to see which feels intuitively a better fit. For practitioners, it can be useful to discuss this directly with clients.
