    Please note that the 'Emotional Energy' alone does not give a very detailed description of a person. It is important to also take into account the 'Fundamental Adult Nature', as well as the 'Surface Energy'. However, it does give a useful overview of their deeper character. The Character Energy also has quite a significant influence on intimate relationships, where the more emotional aspects of ourselves tend to be revealed. There is more information on that in the <a href="{RelationshipsUrl}">Relationships</a> section.
