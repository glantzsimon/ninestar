<h4>Understanding Compatibility in Nine Star Ki</h4>
<p>
    The compatibility calculator offers insight into the energetic potential between two individuals based on their elemental composition within the Nine Star Ki system. While it can indicate tendencies toward harmony or tension, true relational dynamics are shaped by a far wider array of influences than elemental affinity alone.

    Individuals who appear to be elemental opposites may experience deep connection and growth, while those with seemingly ideal compatibility may still encounter conflict. Elemental energy sets the stage—but it is each person's level of self-awareness, emotional maturity, personal history, and relational patterns that ultimately direct the outcome.

    This tool is best used as a reflective guide rather than a definitive measure. It points to potential, not destiny, and should be considered within the broader context of personal evolution and shared experience.
