    The compatiblity reading tool predicts the probability of harmony versus disharmony between two individuals based on their elemental make-up. However, there are a great number of factors that ultimately contribute to relationship dynamics. It is possible for there to be great harmony between two individuals who are elemental polar opposites, just as it is possible for two people whose elements promise great compatibility to clash monumentally.

    The amount of personal development work an individual has done, their upbringing, previous relationship experience, emotional and psychological maturity, as well as many other factors, are all important considerations. This tool should only be used as a general guide. It is not an absolute indicator of what is possible.
