    Core Earth Energies are at the centre of the system and this is often reflected in life, as they are <strong>often at the centre of
        everything they do</strong>, in the personal life and at work. Indeed, Core Earth Energies may even feel left out if this is not so.
</p>
<p>
    In their private life, Core Earth Energies <strong>tend to be outspoken and often take the lead</strong>, with others coming to them for guidance
    and support. Whilst this can be fulfilling, these Energies <strong>must be cautious not to allow themselves to be drained</strong>, as they <strong>can
        give too much of themselves</strong>, to the point of having next to no time to recuperate.

    In Nine Star astrology, the 5 Earth house represents the beginning and end of a cycle and <strong>many 5 Earth Energies lievs' are characterised by ups and downs</strong> and, at times, extremes. However, Core Earth Energies also <strong>possess more resilience than any other of the Energies</strong> and their ability to <strong>learn and bounce back from difficulties</strong> is quite remarkable. A good comparison is the toddler, wandering around wide-eyed and with the most incredible determination, 
    who keeps falling over, only to pick themselves up again and again and carry on. They are unstoppable and possess tremendous strength in their bellies.

    5 Earth Energies <strong>can be unorthodox in their approach</strong> and even a little <strong>over-ambitious</strong> and impractical at times. In this regard, they differ from the other Earth Energies.

<p>
    Core Earth Energies <strong>find it difficult to take advice from others</strong> and often perceive it as a threat. Similarly, they are especially <strong>sensitive to criticism</strong> and may become overly defensive or even more determined to things their own way.
    Indeed, Core Earths often <strong>prefer to learn form their own mistakes</strong>, which is related to the fact that, being the seventh child, they are essentially "outside" of the family.

<p>
    5 Earth Energies can be extremely <strong>bold and determined</strong> and <strong>often bring about great change</strong> in whatever they get involved.
</p>
<p>
    In relationships, <strong>people naturally gravitate to wards 5 Earth Energies</strong>, but being at the centre can mean that these Energies find themselves in unusual circumstances at times, 
    such as being in a love triangle or getting involved with someone much younger or older. There may be further complications such as divorces, stepchildren, etc.
