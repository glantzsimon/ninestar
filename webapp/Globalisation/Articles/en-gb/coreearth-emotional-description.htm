    The outward expression of this character seems bold and demanding to the 
    point of aggressiveness. This is because of the innate leadership potential of 
    the 5 Soil character. Driven by their own needs, they can be very assertive 
    when it comes to making demands. Like a diamond, they can be very strong, 
    selfprotective and extremely persevering. 
    Being at the centre of this system of astrology they can have a controlling 
    influence on whatever they are involved in, at work or at home. The 5 Soil 
    character can exhibit extremes: some are incredibly creative or ambitious, 
    while others are unenthusiastic and lazy or have no goals in life. However, 
    whatever route they take they have the strength to overcome diffculties. 
    They also learn more readily from their mistakes and have the capacity to 
    bounce back more quickly than any of the other signs. They have a great tal- 
    ent for self-preservation.
