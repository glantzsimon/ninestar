    Core Earth is at the centre of the 9 Star Ki system and, as as such, these Energies are typically quite comfortable and compatible with any of the other energies. This central position occupied by 5 Earths can either result in their having quite a lot of compassion and sensitivity to others or, conversely, it can also make them quite "self-centred".

<p>
    It is not uncommon for 5 Earth energies to take the lead in relationships and they can be quite controlling and domineering in some cases. They typically have few problems asserting themselves and asking for what they want.

    Conversely, this Energy can also be expressed as a much softer, gentler nature. In this case, Core Earth energies may well find that their partners make excessive demands of them.

    In a similar way to Soil Energies, there is a potential for Core Earth Energies to become overly dependen on their partner for sexual satisfaction and emotional support.

    Another interesting phenomenon with Core Earths is that they have a propensity to find themselves in unusual circumstances. For example, many 5 Earths may end up with a partner who is significantly older or younger than them. Or their partners may frequently be unavailable because of other commitments or due to living a long way away. Some 5 Earths even find themselves in love triangles.

    Sex is important to these Energies and it is important for 5 Earths to find a partner who has a similar interest in sex. Those under this sign who prefer to take control will also need to ensure that they find a partner who is willing to relinquish it. However, care should be taken not to become self-centred and to also listen to the needs and of their partner.
