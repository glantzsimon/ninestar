    Being at the centre of the 9 energies, 5 Soil energies have no trigram of their own. Rather, they are the axis 
    around which the other energies revolve. As such, this sign draws its nature from each of the other energies. 
    However, it is also said that this Energy is somewhat between 2 Soil and 8 Mountain energies, the other Earth energies in the system.
