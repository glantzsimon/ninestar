    <strong>9 Star Ki astrology is based on the universal cycles of light and dark</strong> and the various transformations between the stages between them. These cosmic cycles, eternally spiralling throughout time and space, underpin our entire reality in this cosmos and give rise to the very experience of being "alive". Examples of these light and dark cycles we all know are the daily solar cycle, the monthly lunar cycle and the yearly seasonal cycle. However, there are many more cycles we have forgotten about in the modern era.

    We each have personal cycles also. <strong>Our lives pass through many cycles. This was understood by many ancient civilisations</strong>, such as the Maya, the Hindus, the Egyptians, etc. <strong>9 Star Ki specifically looks at cycles of nine years and nine months. Knowing where we are in these two cycles alone can have a tremendous positive impact on the way we live our lives.</strong>

    Just as an experienced farmer knows exactly when to plant the seed and when to harvest the crop, so <strong>there is an optimum time for us to sow and to reap the fruit of our efforts in the various activities in which we participate in life. There is an ideal time to rest, recuperate and dream and an ideal time to take action</strong>. Knowing these cycles helps us to harness the power of Nature in everything we do, rather than struggling against the currents in the dark. It can also brings a profound sense of peace and clarity
