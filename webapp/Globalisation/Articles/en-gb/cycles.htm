    9 Star Ki astrology is based on the universal cycles of light and dark and the transformations between the various stages. These cosmic, eternally spiralling throughout time and space, underpin our entire reality in this cosmos and give rise to the very experience of being "alive". This is because, in order for us to be able to experience anything at all, it is necessary to have contrast. Contrast is created from duality, which is created from the coexistence of opposing forces or "energies". For example, the experience of heat is not possible without cold. Neither is light possible without darkness, nor love without fear. There are many different cycles in the cosmos, each one designed for a specific purpose, shaping our reality in ways we yet to fully understand. They vary enormously in duration, purpose and complexity. Some of the cycles are extremely long, whilst some are very short. Together, they form a kind of enormous mechanism, far too vast and complex for the human mind to fathom. However, to give a few more tangible exmples, let us consisder the seasonal changes we see throughout the year or simply the daily sun cycle.

    9 Star Ki ir primarily concerned with the nine year cycle and the smaller nine month cycle within the year. Some of the longer cycles are studied, but we won't be discussing them here. Each of the nine stages of the yearly and monthly cycles affect humans in distinct and predictable ways, both physiologcally and psychologically, giving rise to nine distinct, principle  personality archetypes or "energies", represented by the numbers 1 to 9, each with nine 'sub types' for each of the nine monthly cycles). The nine energies determine many aspects of our personality and also reveal our potential, by describing our inherent strengths and vulnerabilities.
