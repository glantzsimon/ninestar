</h5>
<p>
    9 Star Ki astrology is based on the universal cycles of light and dark and the various transformations between the stages between them. These cosmic cycles, eternally spiralling throughout time and space, underpin our entire reality in this cosmos and give rise to the very experience of being "alive".
</p>
<p>
    In order for us to be able to experience anything at all, it is necessary to have contrast. Contrast is created from duality, which is created from the coexistence of opposing forces or "energies". For example, the experience of heat is not possible without that of cold. Neither is light possible without darkness, nor love without fear.
</p>
<p>
    However, it is much more than just duality. The transformations, which keep the energy in a constant state of evolution and flux, ensure the perpetuity of the entire cosmos. Without the cycles and the transformations life as we know it would come to a standstill. It would not be sustainable. For example, without the death and decay; the breakdown of matter that occurs in the autumn, as well as the period of deep rest and stillness that we go through in the winter, there would be no fertile ground to fuel and support the rapid growth and blossoming that occurs in the spring.
</p>
<p>
    There are many different cycles in the cosmos, each one designed for a specific purpose, shaping our reality in ways we yet to fully understand. They vary enormously in duration, purpose and complexity. Some of the cycles are extremely long, whilst some are very short. Altogether, they form an enormous and complex mechanism which shapes our reality in profound and subtle ways.

    9 Star Ki is primary concerned with 9-year and 9-month cycles
</h5>
<p>
    9 Star Ki is primarily concerned with nine year cycles and a smaller nine month cycle within the year (with the first three months repeating in the last three months of the year).
</p>
<p>
    Each of the nine stages of the yearly and monthly cycles affect us in distinct and predictable ways, both physiologically and psychologically, giving rise to nine distinct, principle personality archetypes or "Energies", represented by the numbers 1 to 9. For example, number 1 is associated with the winter or nighttime, whereas number 9 is associated with summer or the midday sun. Each principle 'Energy' also has a nine sub types for each of the nine monthly cycles. This gives rise to 81 unique personalities.
</p>
<p>
    9 Star Ki determine many aspects of our personality and also reveals our potential, by describing our inherent strengths as well as our vulnerabilities, which are always inextricably linked to our strengths. It also sheds an incredible amount of light on our interactions with others and the interplay of elements that underpin our relationships.
