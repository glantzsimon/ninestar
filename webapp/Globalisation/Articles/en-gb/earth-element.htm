    The Earth element represents the stage that follows the Fire element. One could say that it is made up of the ashes from the fire. In Traditional Chinese medicine the Earth element is associated with later summer or afternoon. However, the Earth element also represents the transition between all of the other stages. As such, it contains the compost from the breaking down of plant matter during the autumn (Metal element), moisture from the Water element (winter) and the roots of trees and plants (Wood element or spring).

    Whilst Earth energies are pretty resilient and calm, they may be prone to worry and anxiety, especially with regards to others.

    Earth energies often have a strong connection with the land and enjoy gardening or nature walks and the like. They tend to be good with their hands,
    be it in the kitchen, the garden, the work place or elsewhere.
