    The Earth element represents the stage that follows the Fire element. One could say that it is made up of the ashes from the fire. In Traditional Chinese medicine the Earth element is associated with later summer or afternoon. However, the Earth element also represents the transition between all of the other stages. As such, it contains the compost from the breaking down of plant matter during the autumn (Metal element), moisture from the Water element (winter) and the roots of trees and plants (Tree element or spring).
