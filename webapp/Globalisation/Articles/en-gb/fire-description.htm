    Fire Energies are bestowed with great <strong>enlightenment and clarity</strong> and can often steer a path through troubled waters. They are often <strong>highly inspirational</strong> individuals who are
    often drawn to situations which require their <strong>brilliant capacity for bringing about change</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    Of all nine Energies, 9 Fires are the <strong>most adept at and comfortable with communication</strong>, especially with regards to emotional and personal experiences. This quality coupled with a
    <strong>warm and passionate nature</strong> can make 9 fires especially <strong>suited to theatre and film</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    On the one hand, these individuals can be <strong>enlightened and liberal</strong>, but on the other they can be <strong>proud, vein and overly critical</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Behind the strong, successful surface lies a more sensitive and insecure nature</strong> that may erupt when offended. However, these individuals are <strong>quick to forgive and forget</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    Like 1 Water Energies, 9 Fires <strong>need their space</strong> and do not like to have it invaded. For this reason, they may, at times, keep people at arms' length.
</p>
<p>
    Despite having a great sense of clarity and ability to see the big picture, Fires are <strong>not especially practical</strong> when it comes to everyday affairs, such as DIY or setting up electronic equipment.
</p>
<p>
    Fire Energies often possess much flare and <strong>appearances are important to them</strong>. This can be seen in the <strong>great care they take in choosing clothing, the contents of their homes</strong>, etc. They may even
    judge others quite harshly if they appear slovenly, sloppy or lacking good manners.
</p>
<p>
    Fire Energies are inspirational and unforgettable and the world would certainly be a much duller place without their uplifting and colourful nature.
