    Fire energies tend to be very expressive, passionate, warm and sociable. They tend to have great clarity and can often steer a path through troubled waters. They can often be highly inspirational individuals who use their passion, great communication skills and emotional sensitivity to bring positive changes to situations, both at home and at work.

    Unlike Earth energies, Fire energies are not especially practical when it comes to everyday affairs.
