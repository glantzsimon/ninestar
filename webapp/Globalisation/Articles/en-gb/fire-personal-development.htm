    Fire is the energy of illumination and clarity. It is also the energy associated with the midday sun. As such, Fire Energies can often see the bigger picture as they have a clear vantage point, like the sun shining down from above. Their insights and perspective are very valuable to others who might not be able to see things as clearly. That being said, a fire needs to be rooted in the hearth and needs plenty of fuel. Therefore, it's important that Fire Energies learn to ground themselves and develop their more practical nature in all that they do and that they take good care of their health.
