    Heaven Energies are <strong>natural leaders</strong> and are comfortable in positions of <strong>authority</strong>, whether it be in
    politics and the military, fashion or the arts.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, their <strong>strong, consistent nature</strong> means that many 6 Metal Energies have broken new ground in their field and paved the way for future generations.
</p>
<p>
    Heaven Energies can be <strong>very moral and noble</strong>, with a strong sense of what is right and wrong, which they are not afraid to communicate to others. They must be careful they do not become overly <strong>judgmental or intolerant</strong> of others or of themselves. Heaven Energies are often <strong>quietly self-critical and perfectionistic</strong> and for this reason,
    they may <strong>take criticism very badly</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    The three consistent Yang lines in their trigram can make Heaven Energies very <strong>rational and pragmatic</strong> in what they do. However, this may also lead to <strong>rigidity and being overly cautious</strong> at times.
</p>
<p>
    6 Metal Energies can be social and active but are generally far more <strong>reserved</strong> than their Yin Metal counterpart.
</p>
<p>
    Heaven Energies place a lot of importance on <strong>family values</strong> and, being natural leaders, they are often very <strong>influential within their families and in the larger community</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    The strong Yang energy of Heaven is also reflected in their <strong>loyalty to their loved ones</strong>, especially in romantic relationships, where they like to take the lead.
</p>
<p>
    Despite being governed by the full force of Yang, the opposite can sometimes be expressed in these Energies in the form of <strong>strong intuition</strong>, empathy and a lot of wisdom with regards to relationships.
