    Heaven energies can be very moral and noble, with a strong sense of what is right and wrong, which they are not afraid to communicate to others.
    They must be careful they do not become overly judgmental or intolerant of others or of themselves. Heaven energies are often quietly self-critical and perfectionistic and for this reason,
    they may take criticism very badly.

    The three consistent yang lines in their trigram can make Heaven energies very rational and pragmatic in what they do. However, this may also lead to rigidity and being overly cautious at times.

    Despite being governed by the full force of yang, the opposite can sometimes be expressed in these energies in the form of strong intuition, empathy and a lot of wisdom with regards to
    relationships.
