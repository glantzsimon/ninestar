    6 Heaven characters benefit from the presence of softer Yin characters, which balance out their strong Yang nature. They can benefit greatly from feedback that can be given in a non-intimidating way, so as not to hurt their delecate pride. The presence of gentler Yin energy in their lives can help 6 Heaven characters from becoming too rigid and domineering in their pursuits.
