<h5>Understanding the I Ching</h5>
<p>
    The <em>I Ching</em>, also known as the <strong>Book of Changes</strong>, is an ancient Chinese divination text that has been used for thousands of years to provide guidance, wisdom, and insight into life's challenges. It is based on a system of <strong>64 hexagrams</strong>, each composed of six lines that represent different states of energy—either <em>yin</em> (receptive) or <em>yang</em> (active). These hexagrams are generated through methods such as tossing coins or yarrow sticks, allowing a person to consult the I Ching for advice.
</p>

<h5>How the I Ching is Used</h5>
<p>
    To consult the I Ching, a person typically formulates a question about their life, relationships, career, or spiritual journey. They then toss three coins six times, each toss forming one of the six lines of a hexagram. This hexagram is then interpreted based on the ancient text, providing insight into the current situation and potential future developments.
</p>
<p>
    Many users also pay close attention to "changing lines"—lines that shift from <em>yin to Yang</em> or vice versa—because they indicate transformation and transition. If a hexagram contains changing lines, a second "transformed" hexagram is also referenced, showing the evolving nature of the situation.
