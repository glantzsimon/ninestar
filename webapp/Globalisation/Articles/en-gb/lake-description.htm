    The season associated with this Energy is late autumn, when the harvest is in and people are enjoying the fruits of their labours, celebrating and having fun.
    For this reason, 7 Metal Energies have a propensity for being <strong>pleasure seekers</strong> and more than any of the other Energies <strong>enjoy spending money on fashion, entertainment and socialising.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Lake Energies are often <strong>great hosts</strong> and unlike their Yang Metal counterparts are often <strong>highly receptive to others and very good listeners</strong>. They also have a <strong>great sense of fun and optimism</strong>
    and often possess a <strong>great sense of humour</strong> too. Similarly, they make <strong>excellent speakers and orators</strong>, thanks to their poise and sense of timing.
</p>
<p>
    Another interesting quality of these Energies is that they <strong>often appear younger than their biological age</strong> and may even have a <strong>childlike quality</strong> to them. They are often quite <strong>charming and charismatic</strong> and can even be flamboyant.
</p>
<p>
    As with 6 Metal Energies, Lakes make <strong>good leaders</strong> but their style is often <strong>gentler and more diplomatic</strong> than that of Heavens. 
    They <strong>tend to offer advice based on what they observe around them</strong> and their suggestions are often extremely valuable, thanks to their keen observational skills and pragmatism.
</p>
<p>
    Lake Energies are often <strong>free-spirited and independent</strong> and make be reluctant to enter into long-term commitments. However, they do also <strong>make great partners</strong> thanks to their <strong>consistent
        and reliable nature</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Lake Energies may swing from the extroverted, fun-loving side of their character to the deeper, more reserved and reflective one.</strong>

    Being the youngest daughter of the family, Lakes benefit from the accumulated wisdom of the rest of the family.
