    Please note that the 'Main Energy' or 'Adult Persona' alone does not give a very detailed description of a person. The 'Character Energy', as well as the 'Surface Energy' play a significant role in shaping a person's character traits. However, the Main Energy does give a very useful overview. Also, of the three components of a personal profile , the Main Energy has the most significant influence on a person's nature and is especially useful when trying to determine the kind of dynamic that is likely to exist between two people. There is more information on that in the <a href="{RelationshipsUrl}">Relationships</a> section.
