    The Metal element is associated with Autumn and late afternoon or evening. It is a stage when the light is fading and the energy is moving downwards and inwards, condensing and consolidating. Autumn is also the time of the harvest, when we begin to gather the fruits of our labour and go indoors to reflect on the past season or day.

    Similarly, Metal energies are very <strong>good at digesting, consolidating and reflecting</strong> upon information. They have a <strong>wide lens</strong> and tend to stay abreast of current affairs, entertainment, the arts, literature, politics, etc. They often accumulate impressive amounts of knowledge and tend to have a very <strong>balanced sense of what is going on around them</strong> and in the world at large.

    Metal people tend to be <strong>thoughtful and observant</strong>, paying careful <strong>attention to detail</strong>. They typically have an objective and balanced way at looking at things. <strong>Justice and fairness</strong> are often important to them.

<p>
    Metal energies often <strong>give good, objective advice</strong> and are clear and decisive. They tend to keep their cool easily under duress. They may also carry a <strong>natural sense of authority</strong>.

<p>
    Metal people tend to be <strong>critical thinkers</strong>, with a strong tendency towards <strong>rationality</strong>. They are usually <strong>direct and straight to the point</strong>. Sometimes the way Metal energies communicate can come across as sharp, blunt, overly critical or insensitive to others. However, the ability to point out uncomfortable truths is an invaluable skill which can be unappealing to the other elements.
