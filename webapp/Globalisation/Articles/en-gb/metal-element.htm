    The Metal element is associated with Autumn and late afternoon or evening. It is a stage when the light is fading and the energy is moving downwards and inwards, condensing and consolidating. It is also the time of the harvest, when we begin to gather the fruits of our labour and go indoors to reflect on the past season or day.

    Metal people tend to be thoughtful and observant, paying careful attention to detail. They typically have an objective and balanced way at looking at things. Indeed, justice and fairness are often important to them.

    Metal energies often give good, objective advice and are clear and decisive. They may also carry a natural sense of authority.

    Sometimes the way Metal energies communicate can come across as sharp, blunt or insensitive to others. However, the ability to point out uncomfortable truths is an invaluable which is often unappealing to the other elements.
