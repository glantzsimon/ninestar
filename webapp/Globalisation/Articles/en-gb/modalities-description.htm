    The nine Energies in the 9 Star Ki system, as well as being grouped by Yin or Yang and by the five elements, can also be split into three groups, called the 'Modalities'. This is very similar to the Modalities described in the Zodiac. It is another simple yet useful 'map' that can be used to understand people's fundamental nature.
