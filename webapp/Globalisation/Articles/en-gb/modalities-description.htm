<h5>
    9 Star Ki has 3 'Modalities', similar to those of the Zodiac
</h5>
<p>
    The nine Energies in the 9 Star Ki system, as well as being grouped by Yin or Yang and by the five elements, can also be split into three groups, called the 'Modalities'. This is very similar to the Modalities described in the Zodiac. It is another simple yet useful 'map' that can be used to understand people's fundamental nature.

    You may find it interesting to know that the 9 Star Ki Modalities overlap to a large extent with the Modalities of the Zodiac. The same astral bodies are at play!
