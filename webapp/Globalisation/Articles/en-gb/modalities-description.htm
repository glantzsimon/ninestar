    9 Star Ki has 3 groups or 'Modalities', similar to those of the Zodiac and of Chinese Astrology

<p>
    The nine Energies in the 9 Star Ki system, as well as being grouped by Yin or Yang and by the five elements, can also be split into three groups or 'Modalities'. This is very similar to the modalities described in the Zodiac and the three groups of Chinese Astrology. It is another simple yet useful 'map' that can be used to understand people's fundamental nature.
