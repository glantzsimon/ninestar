    8 Mountain characters are by far the most private of all of the energies. They value their own space and can be verbally very uncommunicative. Some 8 Mountain characters may find other channels for self expression, such as music, art or through their work.

    The Mountain is a good description of this character, with its hard exterior protecting a much softer underbelly, which is usually only revealed once people get to know them better. Many friends and family turn to 8 Mountain characters for help as they can be extremely supportive and caring: like a rock.

    Outwardly 8 Mountain characters usually give the impression that they are calm and immovable. However, they can also express a more impulsive and energetic or restless nature. They can be quite adventurous and free-spirited. However, at other times they can be self-indulgent and greedy.

    Perhaps the greatest strength of the 8 Mountain character is their single-mindedness. When inspired, nothing will deter them from getting the job done. At times, this may go to the extreme and become fanatical.
