    9 Star Ki (pronounced 'key', which is the Japanese word for subtle energy or life-force) is possibly the oldest system of astrology in the world today. Originating in China, it is closely related to the 4000 year-old Book of Changes - the 'I Ching' - whose principles are the foundations of Feng Shui, traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture.
