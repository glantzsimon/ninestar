<h5>
    A 4000-Year-Old System Rooted in the Wisdom of the East

<p>
    9 Star Ki (pronounced “key,” the Japanese word for subtle energy or life-force) is possibly the oldest system of astrology in the world. It originated in ancient China and is closely connected to the <em>I Ching</em>, or Book of Changes—a 4000-year-old text that forms the philosophical foundation of Feng Shui, traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture, and the Five Element system.

    Originally used for decision-making in everything from health and agriculture to family life and governance, 9 Star Ki was later preserved and refined in Japan. The version we use today retains the ancient core while offering a profoundly accessible map of human nature and the cycles of time.
