    The main part of the 9 Star Ki personal chart is comprised of three numbers, each from 1 to 9. For example: <strong>"3.1.7"</strong>. 
</p>
<h5>
    First Number - Solar Energy
</h5>
<p>
    The first number is <strong>determined by the year we were born</strong> and corresponds to our <strong>fundamental nature</strong>; the lens through which we view the world and the way we make sense of reality. It is also the Energy <strong>that holds the strongest influence as we reach adulthood</strong>, round the age of 18, which is 2 complete 9-year cycles. Up until the age of 18, whilst the primary number is still influencial, it is the second number (the emotional energy) which is the most significant influence..
</p>

<h5>
    Second Number - Lunar Energy / Emotional Nature / Inner Child
</h5>
<p>
    The second number is <strong>determined by the month in which we were born</strong> and corresponds to our <strong>deeper, more emotional nature or inner child</strong>. In adults, this is typically only revealed when we establish a closer connection with someone. It is also the Energy that is <strong>often expressed when we are emotional or stressed</strong> in some way. As mentioned above, it is also the <strong>predominant Energy of children and adolescents</strong>.
</p>

<h5>Third Number -  Social Expression</h5>
<p>
    The third number corresponds to the energy which is most visible on the outside. It is the <strong>first impression we often give</strong> to the world. It also has a greater influence on <strong>how we tend to act socially, especially when we are with people we don't know so well or have deeper bonds with</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    In addition to these three numbers, there is also the Ki of the Epoch or 81-year period a person was born into, as well as the Generation or 9-year period as well as smaller periods of time such as the daily Ki and even hourly Ki. However, the first three numbers are more than enough to get a clear picture of a person. In the Personal Chart we provide details on all of the numbers, for those who are interested in delving deeper.
</p>

<h5>
    The unique blend of the 3 primary numbers creates 81 distinct personalities
</h5>
<p>
    The unique blend of all three numbers creates 81 distinct profiles, spanning 9 years and influences our personality, our strengths and weaknesses, our emotions, the way we process information and make sense of the world around us. It also has a major influence on the way we interact with others (there is more information on this in the Five Elements section). None of the energies or profiles are inherently superior or inferior to any other. Each Energy represents a unique expression of the divine and symbolises a specific stage in the cycle of light and dark; of birth and death.
</p>
<h5>
    9 Star Ki is uncannily accurate
</h5>
<p>
    Regardless of upbringing, culture or genetics, 9 Star Ki remains remarkably precise. It is natural to find some attributes associated with our Energy more flattering than others. In 9 Star Ki, it is understood that our strengths are inextricably linked to our vulnerabilities. Nobody can be and do all things. Our 9 Star Ki personal chart exerts a significant influence over our potential and the attributes that are most likely to be expressed both when we are in balance and when we are out of balance.

<p>
    That being said, some people may feel their chart does not accurately portray them. This is especially true when some of their potential is blocked. Of course, there are exceptions to the rules and there can be hidden factors at play that are hard to predict.
