    9 Star Ki is an immensely useful tool for understanding the underlying and often misunderstood dynamics that drive our relationships. Have you ever wondered why certain individuals just seem to rub you up the wrong way, or conversely, why you just can't seem to get through to certain types of people under certain circumstances? Many of us are aware that some relationships are naturally more harmonious and require less "effort" than others. However, understanding 9 Star Ki and the 5 transformations can be tremendously elucidating and help us not only to take blame out of the equation, but also to start to learn new tools to help us create more harmony in our lives. By understanding how 9 Star Ki effects the ways in which people perceive the world and the interplay of energies and elements between us, we can learn to appreciate and grow from some of the more challenging relationshis in our lives, rather than seeing them as an annoyance or inconvenience.
