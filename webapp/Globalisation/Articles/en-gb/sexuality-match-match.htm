    This can be a powerful combination for establishing a confident understanding and expression of your own sexuality. Having both your deeper and surface nature in line with your gender makes you fully at ease with who you are. Being ‘all male’ or ‘all female’ can give you all the traditionally understood traits of your gender. For a man this may mean presenting yourself as macho man, strong and sexually confident. For a woman you could appear sensual and very feminine. In the same way that the trigram for Earth (three broken lines) and that for Heaven (three bold lines) are traditionally viewed as the archetypal expressions of female and male energy respectively, you may have a somewhat idealistic view of relationships and sex.  Your search for a partner may therefore take you a long time. You may have strong views about what you want from a relationship, and sometimes you will be disappointed when your partner does not match up to your ideal. Deep down you are comfortable with your own gender and sexuality, so you have no need to achieve sexual satisfaction all the time. You may go through long periods of celibacy, which are not a challenge for you. You are quite prepared to wait for the ‘right person’. Because you are secure and comfortable in your sexuality you like to make good friends of the opposite sex. However, because you lack the opposite gender in your make-up you may not fully understand them.
