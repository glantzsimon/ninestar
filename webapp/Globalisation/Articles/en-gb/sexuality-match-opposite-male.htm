<h4>
    Fundamental Energy is Yang and in line with gender. Emotional Energy is Yin and opposite to gender
</h4>
<h5>
    Quite a balanced combination
</h5>
<p>
    This is quite a balanced combination that gives men a fairly even keel in understanding both their own sexuality and that of {SexualPartnersText}.
</p>
<h5>
    Emotional Energy is opposite to gender, resulting in a good understanding of {PotentialMatesText}
</h5>
<p>
    Emotional Energy is opposite to gender, which likely gives men with this combination a deep understanding of {PotentialMatesText}, who probably feel at ease and unthreatened in their company.
</p>
<h5>
    Although at ease with {PotentialMatesText}, there may be a risk of misunderstanding
</h5>
<p>
    Men with this combination have the capacity to be excellent counsellors, friends or listeners to potental mates. However, this feeling of confidence and natural ease can be misunderstood as a sexual advance.
</p>
<h5>
    These men can be hardest to get to know on a deeper, sexual level
</h5>
<p>
    The Fundamental Energy is in line with gender, and may mean that men with this combination find it more difficult to express their emotions, needs and desires to {SexualPartnersText}. However, it can be misleading, as the Emotional Energy is opposite to gender and may give the impression that these men are very much at ease in the company of {SexualPartnersText}. For that reason, of all the four combinations, these men can be the hardest to get to know on a deeper sexual level.
