    This combination gives you a very even keel in understanding your own sexuality, and a clear insight into members of either sex. Your surface nature is opposite to your gender, so when members of the opposite sex encounter this in their immediate dealings with you they will feel very comfortable and unthreatened. Your deep understanding of the opposite sex, which is borne out by your character number being the same as theirs, can put you into a great position of trust or confidence. You have the capacity to be an excellent counsellor, friend or listener to members of the opposite sex. But this feeling of confidence and natural ease with the opposite sex can be misunderstood as a sexual advance. Since your principal number is the same as your gender, and the principal number always relates to our deeper sexual identity, you may at times be unable to express your emotions easily. Of all the four combinations, you are probably the hardest to get to know on this level. However, this side of your nature is not immediately apparent to members of the opposite sex, as you are so much at ease with them through having your character number in line with their gender.
