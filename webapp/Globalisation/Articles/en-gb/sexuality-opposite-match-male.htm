    During adolescence, the Character Energy is the driving force of one's personality and, in this instance, would have been in line with gender. Men with this combination are therefore typically very confident and at ease with {SexualPartnersText} during this time, finding them non-threatening. Conversely, as they approach the age of 18, the influence of the Fundamental Energy, which is Yin and therefore opposite to gender, begins to be felt, resulting in the likelihood of increased misunderstanding or mistrust of {PotentialMatesText}.

Having both combinations within their chart often gives these men great intuition and insight into others’ lives. However, it may well be difficult for them to apply this understanding to their own situation.
