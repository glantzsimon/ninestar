    During your adolescence, when your character number was the driving force of your personality, it would have been in line with your gender. Therefore at that age you may have been very confident with the opposite sex, finding them non-threatening and being totally at ease with them. But as you approached the age of 18 and began to move into the influence of your principal number you may have come to misunderstand or mistrust the opposite sex. When you are an adult your gender appears on the surface of your nature. This may result in you emphasising your maleness or femininity in your outward expression, which could mean the way you dress or the way you communicate. When your own gender appears on the surface through your character, it is harder for you to relate to members of the opposite sex, who may feel threatened by your superficial masculinity/femininity. With your principal number opposite your own gender this can leave you feeling very insecure about your sexuality on a deeper level. Despite these challenges, of all four combinations you have the greatest potential for an objective understanding of other people’s relationships and sexuality. Having both combinations within your chart gives you great intuition and insight into others’ lives. However, it is difficult for you to apply this depth of understanding to your own situation.
