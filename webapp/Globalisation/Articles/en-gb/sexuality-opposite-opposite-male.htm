<h4>
    Both Fundamental and Character energies are Yin and therefore opposite to gender

<h5>
    Quite a challenging combination for men who feel pressure to behave more like alpha males
</h5>
<p>
    This combination can be quite challenging, especially for men whose culture or upbringing might put even more pressure on them to behave like alpha males, or whichever role model is most culturally and socially appropriate.
</p>
<h5>
    This combination can result in some insecurity around sexuality, leading to potential obsession with sex
</h5>
<p>
    On a deeper level, the result of this combination could be a certain insecurity with regards to sexuality. Rather than losing interest in sex, this tends to have the exact opposite effect and could potentially lead to a person becoming obsessed with it.
</p>
<p>
    Men with this combination often posess a tremendous libido, but the lack of Yang in both the Fundamental and Character numbers may lead to a chronic dissatisfaction with sex.
</p>
<h5>
    There may well be fear of deeper, emotional intimacy with {SexualPartnersText}
</h5>
<p>
    If an obsession with sex results from this combination, it can present itself in a number of ways. For example, there may be some fear of deeper intimacy with {SexualPartnersText}, resulting in an avoidance of deeper emotional connection and commitment and a preference for more casual sexual encounters that are based purely on sexual gratification.
</p>
<h5>
    This combination may lead to these men exploiting {SexualPartnersText} for sex
</h5>
<p>
    Conversely, men with this combination of Energies are unlikely to be taken advantage by others as their insecurity tends to make them more defensive.
</p>
<p>
    This combination could also lead to these men exploiting {SexualPartnersText} to some extent, as well as blaming them or having difficulty trusting them.
