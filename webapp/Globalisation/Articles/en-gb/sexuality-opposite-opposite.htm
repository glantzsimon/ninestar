    This combination can be a challenge, as you lack your own gender in either your principal or character number. On a deeper level this can leave you insecure in your sexuality, which, rather than make you lose any interest in sex, tends to have the opposite effect – you can become almost obsessed with it. This obsession can give you tremendous libido, but the lack of gender in your principal and character numbers may lead to dissatisfaction with sex itself. Any obsession with sex can manifest in a number of ways – for example, you may have a deep-seated and unjustified fear of the opposite sex. As a result you may want to take advantage of the opposite sex by not committing yourself to a relationship or by using your partner for your own satisfaction. Because of your own insecurity you are unlikely to be taken advantage of and are more likely to be on the defensive. It is possible that you could exploit the opposite sex, blame them or have difficulty in trusting them. Although you are fundamentally independent by nature, in your search for your sexual identity you may find role models from your own gender and may try to live up to some idealised view of what a man or woman should be.
