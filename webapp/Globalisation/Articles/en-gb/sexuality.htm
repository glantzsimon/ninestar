    9 Star Ki can tell us some truly fascinating and also incredibly useful information about our sexuality and our relationships with others. In the <a target="_blank" href="{AboutLink}">{AboutTitle}</a> section we discuss the concept of the Great Principle of 'Yin and Yang'.
</p>

<h4>Yin and Yang and its relationship to gender roles</h4>
<h5>
    For millenia society has tended to have fixed gender roles, making it hard for many men and women to find their true sexual expression
</h5>
<p>
    For millenia, society has tended to have quite fixed gender roles and associations which have not necessarily reflected people's true nature.
    In the majority of world cultures, men have, to a large extent, been expected to act like alpha males and have often felt the need to hide any natural traits that could be viewed as "feminine". Equally, women have been expected to adopt roles that society as deemed more "feminine" and have also often felt the need to hide any natural tendencies that didn't fit the mould handed to them.

    Today we are developing deeper understanding about the cosmic Feminine and Masculine, or "Yin" and "Yang" Energies and how they affect human beings
</h5>
<p>
    Today many of these myths still persist; however, they are slowly fading, as we develop a deeper understanding about the cosmic Feminine and Masculine, or "Yin" and "Yang" Energies and how they affect human beings. In truth, men and women, in their most natural expression, can embody a wide range of masculine and feminine traits. Gender roles are nothing like as fixed as we traditionally believed them to be. Many gay and transgender people are leading the way in enlightening the world on these matters; however, many people still struggle with this, regardless of their sexuality.

<h4>Our Fundamental Energy and its relationship to sexuality</h4>
<h5>
    Our <a target="_blank" href="{ChartLink}">Fundamental Energy</a> is intimately connected to our deeper sense of sexual security and identity
</h5>
<p>
    Our <a target="_blank" href="{ChartLink}">Fundamental Energy</a> is intimately connected to our deeper sense of sexual security and identity and affects how comfortable an individual is likely to feel with his or her sexuality. Each of the nine Energies is considered either Yin ("feminine") or Yang ("masculine"). For example, 1 Water Energies is considered Yang, whereas 2 Earth Energies are Yin.
</p>
<p>
    If a person's Fundamental Energy is in alignment with their biological gender, this tends to result in their having a deeper sense of security in regards to their sexuality. 
</p>
<p>
    If the Fundamental Energy is opposite to a person's gender, then this can result their having a more complex relationship with their sexuality and they may find it harder to relate to members of the opposite sex.
</p>

<h4>Our Character Energy and its relationship to sexuality</h4>
<h5>
    Our <a target="_blank" href="{ChartLink}">Character Energy</a> has more of an influence on the way we express our sexuality overtly or superficially
</h5>
<p>
    Our <a target="_blank" href="{ChartLink}">Character Energy</a> has more of an influence on the way we express our sexuality overtly or superficially. For example, it could affect how a person dresses, their mannerisms and behaviour with regards to attracting a mate, as well as their behaviour in relationships. When a person's Character Energy reflects their biological gender, they are more likely to dress and behave in a way that is typically associated with that gender, sometimes to the extreme.
</p>
<p>
    Conversely, if the Character Energy is opposite to biological gender, then the person typically feels comfortable with and can relate more deeply to members of the opposite sex, with or without the presence of a strong sexual attraction.

    <strong>Note: </strong> for gay people, this works slightly differently. For example, if a gay man is very comfortable with his sexuality, is openly feminine in his expression and prefers to take a sexually passive role, then it's likely that the rules regarding gender can be reversed. Alternatively, for a gay man who is naturally more masculine and sexually active, then the above probably still applies. However, how masculine or feminine a person is is not necessarily a reflection of how they function sexually. For transgender people, it may be harder still to predict how 9 Star Ki influences sexuality. It is nuanced and the particularities are beyond the scope of this site.
