    9 Star Ki can tell us some <strong>truly fascinating and also incredibly useful information about our sexuality and our relationships</strong> with others. In the <a target="_blank" href="{AboutLink}">{AboutTitle}</a> section we discuss the concept of the Great Principle of 'Yin and Yang'.
</p>

<h4>Yin and Yang and its relationship to gender roles</h4>
<h5>
    For millenia society has tended to have fixed gender roles, making it hard for many men and women to find their true sexual expression
</h5>
<p>
    For millenia, society has tended to have quite <strong>fixed gender roles and associations</strong> which have <strong>not necessarily reflected people's true nature</strong>. In the majority of world cultures, <strong>men have, to a large extent, been expected to act like alpha males</strong> and have often felt the need to <strong>hide any natural traits that could be viewed as "feminine"</strong>. Equally, <strong>women have been expected to adopt roles that society as deemed more "feminine"</strong> and have also often felt the need to hide any natural tendencies that didn't fit the mould handed to them.
</p>

    Today we are developing deeper understanding about the cosmic Feminine and Masculine, or "Yin" and "Yang" Energies and how they affect human beings
</h5>
<p>
    Today <strong>many of these myths still persist; however, they are slowly fading</strong>, as we develop a deeper understanding about the cosmic Feminine and Masculine, or "Yin" and "Yang" Energies and how they affect human beings. In truth, <strong>men and women, in their most natural expression, can embody a wide range of masculine and feminine traits</strong>. Gender roles are nothing like as fixed as we traditionally believed them to be. Many gay and transgender people are leading the way in enlightening the world on these matters; however, many people still struggle with this, regardless of their sexuality.

<h4>Our Fundamental Energy and its relationship to sexuality</h4>
<h5>
    Our <a target="_blank" href="{ChartLink}">Fundamental Energy</a> is intimately connected to our deeper sense of sexual security and identity
</h5>
<p>
    Our <a target="_blank" href="{ChartLink}">Fundamental Energy</a> is <strong>intimately connected to our deeper sense of sexual security and identity</strong> and affects how comfortable an individual is likely to feel with his or her sexuality. Each of the nine Energies is considered either Yin ("feminine") or Yang ("masculine"). For example, 1 Water Energies is considered Yang, whereas 2 Earth Energies are Yin.
</p>
<p>
    If a person's <strong>Fundamental Energy is in alignment with their biological gender</strong>, this tends to result in their having a <strong>deeper sense of security</strong> in regards to their sexuality. 
</p>
<p>
    If the Fundamental <strong>Energy is opposite to a person's gender</strong>, then this can result their having a <strong>more complex relationship with their sexuality</strong> and they may find it harder to relate to members of the opposite sex.
</p>

<h4>Our Character Energy and its relationship to sexuality</h4>
<h5>
    Our <a target="_blank" href="{ChartLink}">Character Energy</a> has more of an influence on the way we express our sexuality overtly or superficially
</h5>
<p>
    Our <a target="_blank" href="{ChartLink}">Character Energy</a> has more of an influence on the way we express our sexuality overtly or superficially. For example, it could affect <strong>how a person dresses</strong>, their <strong>mannerisms and behaviour with regards to attracting a mate</strong>, as well as their <strong>behaviour in relationships</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    When a person's <strong>Character Energy reflects their biological gender</strong>, they are more <strong>likely to dress and behave in a way that is typically associated with that gender</strong>, sometimes to the extreme.
</p>
<p>
    Conversely, if the <strong>Character Energy is opposite to biological gender</strong>, then the person typically feels <strong>comfortable with and can relate more deeply to members of the opposite sex</strong>, with or without the presence of a strong sexual attraction.

    <strong>Note: </strong> for gay people, this works slightly differently. For example, if a gay man is very comfortable with his sexuality, is openly feminine in his expression and prefers to take a sexually passive role, then it's likely that the rules regarding gender can be reversed. Alternatively, for a gay man who is naturally more masculine and sexually active, then the above probably still applies. However, <strong>how masculine or feminine a person is is not necessarily a reflection of how they function sexually</strong>. For transgender people, it may be harder still to predict how 9 Star Ki influences sexuality. It is nuanced and the particularities are beyond the scope of this site.
