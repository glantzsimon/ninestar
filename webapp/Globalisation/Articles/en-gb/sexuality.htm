    9 Star Ki can tell us some truly fascinating and also incredibly useful information about our sexuality and our relationships with others. In the <a target="_blank" href="{AboutLink}">{AboutTitle}</a> section we discuss the concept of the Great Principle of 'Yin and Yang'.

<h4>Yin and Yang and its relationship to gender roles</h4>
<p>
    For millenia, society has tended to have quite fixed gender roles and associations which have not necessarily reflected people's true nature.
    In the majority of world cultures, men have, to a large extent, been expected to act like alpha males and have often felt the need to hide any natural traits that could be viewed as "feminine". Equally, women have been expected to adopt roles that society as deemed more "feminine" and have also often felt the need to hide any natural tendencies that didn't fit the mould handed to them.

In truth, men and women, in their most natural expression, can embody a wide range of masculine and feminine traits. Gender roles are nothing like as fixed as we traditionally believed them to be. Many gay and transgender people are leading the way in enlightening the world on these matters; however, many people still struggle with this, regardless of their sexuality.

If a person's Fundamental Energy is in alignment with their actual gender, this tends to result in their having a deeper sense of security in regards to their sexuality. However, if the Fundamental Energy is opposite to a person's gender, then this can result in a person having a more complex relationship with their sexuality.
