    Soil men are typically gentle and nurturing and relationships
</h5>
<p>
    Soil men are gentle and nurturing and often have quite a mothering quality to them, which may be attractive to potential mates or not, depending on what they are looking for. Due to gender stereotypes that exist today, many men, especially straight men, feel uncomfortable expressing this role. Similarly, potential mates may subconsciously judge 2 Soil men as overly mothering and feminine, unaware that they may be responding to these gender stereotypes to some extent.

    Being a Yin energy, 2 Earth men may be hesitant to make the first move in relationships and are typically attracted to Yang Energies.
