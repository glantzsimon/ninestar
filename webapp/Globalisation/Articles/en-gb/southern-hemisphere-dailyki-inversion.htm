    Inversion of the daily and hourly Ki for the Southern Hemisphere
</h5>

<p>Traditionally, 9 Star Ki and Feng Shui practitioners used the same ascending and descending daily and hourly Ki for both hemispheres. However, at 9starkiastrology.com we believe that whether the daily or hourly Ki ascends or descends depends on the seasonal contraction and expansion of energies, which is hemisphere specific. You can observe how energy expands as we move towards the summer solstice and contracts as we move towards the winter solstice. Interestingly, ancient observers noted a slight delayed effect, which is why the change in direction occurs several weeks after the solstice rather than precisely on it.</p>
