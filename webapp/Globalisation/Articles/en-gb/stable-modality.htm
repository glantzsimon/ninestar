    Stable Energies are steady and solid. They generally process information more slowly, are pragmatic and risk-averse, and prefer to plan ahead. They are less comfortable with change—especially when it is instigated by others.

    Energies {soil}, {coreearth}, and {mountain} are classified as 'stable'. As you can see, they are all of the Earth elements. Earth is by nature steady, grounded, and reliable. This group is similar to the Fixed Modality of the Zodiac and the <strong>Relational Group</strong> of Chinese Astrology, which includes the Rabbit, Sheep, Pig, and Rat — signs known for emotional intelligence, empathy, and a desire for harmony. Like Stable Energies, they are the social fabric of families and communities, offering connection, kindness, and cohesion.

    Stable Energies like to plan ahead and tend to hold long-term goals, which they are good at sticking to. They are pragmatic and can be quite single-minded when they commit to a path.

<p>
    They tend to process information slowly and steadily, weighing the pros and cons. They accumulate knowledge gradually over time and often have strong long-term memories. Rational by nature, they avoid unnecessary risks and are particularly resistant to change that comes from outside themselves. In this way, they may be seen as the most stubborn of the three groups.

<p>
    While Stable Energies can be either introverted or extroverted (with Yang types leaning more outwardly), they are generally much less verbally and emotionally expressive than the Dynamic Energies. Yet, they often express care through consistency, loyalty, and grounded support.

<p>
    Stable Energies are the solid foundations on which society is built. Without them, there would be chaos.
