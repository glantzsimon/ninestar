    Static people thend to process information slowly and steadily, weighing up the pros and cons. They accumulate knowledge gradually over time and tend to have good long-term memories. They tend to be rational thinkers and don't like to take too many risks. They are more resistant to change, especially when it's not instigated by them. You could say they are the most stubborn of the three groups.

    Static Energies are the solid foundations on which society is built. Without them, there would be chaos.
