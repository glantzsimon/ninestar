    9 Star Ki astrology is based on the universal cycles of light and dark and the transformations between the various stages. This is similar to the seasonal changes we see throughout the year or even throughout each day and night. There are many different cycles of differing lengths, all of which fit into one another like the layers of an onion. Some of the cycles are very long.

    In order to understand one's energetic make-up and potential, it is sufficient to observe the nine year cycle and the smaller nine month cycle within the year. Each of the nine stages of the cycle affect humans in distinct and predictable ways, both physiologcally and psychologically, giving rise to nine different personality archetypes or "energies", represented by the numbers 1 to 9. The nine energies determine many aspects of our personality and also reveal our potential, by describing our inherent strengths and vulnerabilities.
