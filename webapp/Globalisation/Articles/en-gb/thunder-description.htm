    Thunder Energies embody the power of spring and have <strong>plenty of vitality and energy</strong>. They are more about doing than being and like to take <strong>action and initiate</strong>.
</p>

    Thunder Energies are generally <strong>very positive and joyful</strong>, and their <strong>optimism and abundant energy</strong> as well as their ability to take strong action makes them <strong>great pioneers</strong> in any field they turn their attention to.
    However, in their constant pursuit of new pastures, <strong>they may not stick around long enough to figure out the details</strong>, which they often leave to others. Thunder Energies often have <strong>great bursts of energy</strong> which can lead to great action. These bursts of energy and movement may be interspersed with periods of lethargy and even exhaustion if care is not taken to take sufficient rest.

    Like thunder, three Thunder Energies can, at times, be <strong>explosive and unpredictable</strong>, a trait which some may find overwhelming. However, it is this quality which enables Thunder Energies to
    <strong>instigate great change</strong>. Those who dislike change and interruption may dislike the <strong>vigorous and optimistic nature</strong> of those born under this star.

    Three Thunder Energies tend to be very <strong>open and frank in their communication</strong>, sometimes to the point of offending others, albeit unintentionally. One could say they <strong>lack a brain-mouth filter</strong>.
    This openness also applies to their <strong>charm and great sense of humour</strong>, which can sometimes get them out of the trouble their tongue gets them into.
</p>
<p>
    Being highly creative, Thunder Energies can sometimes get carried away and <strong>develop grandiose or unrealistic ideas</strong>. For this reason, they often <strong>benefit greatly from the input of other Energies to refine and ground their vision</strong>.

    Being the eldest son of the family, Thunder Energies <strong>often develop early in life</strong>, with success in childhood. Men under this sign often have a strong virile nature, but equally, may be extremely sensitive and gentle.
