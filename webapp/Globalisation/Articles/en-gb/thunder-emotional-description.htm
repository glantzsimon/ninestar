    3 Thunder has the full force of spring in its nature, or the dawn.

    3 Thunder characters are <strong>forward-thinking and enjoy initiating new projects</strong> and
    discussing new concepts.
</p>
<p>
    3 Thunder characters tend to be <strong>very lively and energetic</strong>. They can also be very <strong>verbally expressive</strong> and some of the quieter Energies may find them a <strong>overly talkative at times</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    Whilst 3 Thunder characters are full of bright new ideas, they tend to <strong>lose interest quickly</strong> and may not stick around to see things through. However, when working as a team, this is not a problem, as the other, more stable Energies can pick up the baton and run with their creations.

<p>
    A common trait of 3 Thunder characters is to <strong>take on too many thigns at once</strong>, which can get rather <strong>chaotic</strong> at times.
</p>
<p>
    3 Thunders tend to have <strong>a very adventurous and even impulsive</strong> nature. 
    
    They have a <strong>strong presence and their mood often affects everyone around them</strong>, for better or for worse. 
</p>
<p>
    Those with a 3 Thunder character <strong>can be very competitive</strong> and are often sore losers. They can take defeat very personally. They also tend to like to get their own way and <strong>can express great frustration when things don't go to plan</strong>.
