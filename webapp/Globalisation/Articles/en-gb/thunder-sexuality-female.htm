<h5>
    3 Tree Energies often have a high sex drive
</h5>
<p>
    Representing the full force of spring, 3 Tree Energies often have the strongest libido of all 9 Energies. Indeed, sex is usually of great importance to them. 3 Tree women, as their Fundamental Energy is opposite to their gender, are often quite sexually active and even promiscuous. They sometimes even struggle with sex addition.
</p>
<p>
    3 Tree women, of all the 9 Energies, are perhaps the least likely to conform to gender stereotypes and typically like to make the first move. Their strong Yang nature often attracts more Yin partners. However, for straight women, this can sometimes lead to frustration or disatisfaction if they subconsciously look for a man who conforms to society's gender stereotypes (which is more Yang).

</h5>
<p>
    3 Tree women often display great confidence in their sexual expression. They like to make the first move - to chase, so to speak - and are typically more attracted to more Yin energies, although it is not strictly the case.

</h5>

<h5>
    3 Trees are often precocious in their sexual development and have a natural exploratory nature
</h5>
<p>
    Being the expression of spring, or morning, 3 Trees are often precocious and eager to explore, which can often result in a strong desire to experiment with different methods of love-making. It can also lead to them discovering their sexuality at a relatively young age.
