    The Tree element is associated with the spring and embodies the power of growth and new beginnings. Tree people have plenty of vitality and energy and are typically optimistic and forward-looking.

    Whilst Metal energies are good at digesting and consolidating everything that has already been created, Tree energies are much more focussed on generating new ideas and solutions. There is often a pioneering quality to Tree people. And whilst they are excellent at getting things started, in their constant pursuit of new pastures, they may not stick around long enough to figure out the details, which they often leave to others. Is especially true of 3 Tree people.

    The creative power of Tree energies can lead to some truly ground-breaking and ingenious developments. However, Trees can also get carried away and develop grandiose or unrealistic ideas. For this reason, Tree people typically need the efforts of the other energies in order to refine and ground their vision.

    Tree energies can be unpredictable, changeable and even impulsive. This can be challenging and overwhelming for other energies, especially Earth and Metal energies, who are more grounded and stable in their approach.
