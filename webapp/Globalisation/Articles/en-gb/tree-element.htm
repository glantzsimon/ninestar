    The Tree element is associated with the dawn or spring and embodies the power of growth and new beginnings. Tree people have plenty of <strong>vitality and energy</strong> and are typically <strong>optimistic and forward-looking</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    Whilst Metal Energies like to digest and consolidate that which is already manifest, Tree Energies are much more <strong>focussed on generating new ideas and solutions</strong>. The trajectory of their <strong>thinking often resembles an actual tree, moving upwards and outwards</strong>, forever <strong>branching off into new directions</strong>. This can be overwhelming to other Energies, who may struggle to keep up. However, it is also the source of their creative genius.
</p>
<p>
    There is often a <strong>pioneering</strong> quality to Tree people and whilst they are <strong>excellent at getting things started</strong>, in their constant pursuit of new pastures, they <strong>may not stick around long enough to figure out the details</strong>, which they often leave to others. Is especially true of 3 Tree people.
</p>
<p>
    The creative power of Tree Energies can lead to some truly <strong>ground-breaking and ingenious</strong> developments. However, Trees <strong>can also get carried away and become grandiose or unrealistic</strong> at times. For this reason, Tree people need the efforts and input of the other Energies in order to refine and ground their vision.
</p>
<p>
    Tree Energies can be <strong>unpredictable, changeable and even impulsive</strong>. This can be challenging for other Energies, especially for Earth and Metal people, who are more grounded and stable in their approach.
