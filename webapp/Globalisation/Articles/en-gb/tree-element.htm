    The Tree element is associated with the dawn or spring and embodies the power of growth and new beginnings. Tree people have plenty of vitality and energy and are typically optimistic and forward-looking.

    Whilst Metal Energies like to digest and consolidate that which is already manifest, Tree Energies are much more focussed on generating new ideas and solutions. The trajectory of their thinking often resembles an actual tree, moving upwards and outwards, forever branching off into new directions. This can be overwhelming to other Energies, who may struggle to keep up. However, it is also the source of their creative genius.

    There is often a pioneering quality to Tree people and whilst they are excellent at getting things started, in their constant pursuit of new pastures, they may not stick around long enough to figure out the details, which they often leave to others. Is especially true of 3 Tree people.

    The creative power of Tree Energies can lead to some truly ground-breaking and ingenious developments. However, Trees can also get carried away and become grandiose or unrealistic at times. For this reason, Tree people need the efforts and input of the other Energies in order to refine and ground their vision.

    Tree Energies can be unpredictable, changeable and even impulsive. This can be challenging for other Energies, especially for Earth and Metal people, who are more grounded and stable in their approach.
