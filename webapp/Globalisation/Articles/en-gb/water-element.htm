    The Water element is associated with winter and the night. It is the darkest stage of the cycle when things move into dormancy and stillness. It is a time of deep rest and regeneration as well as time for reflection and dreaming. The Water element is the result of the breakdown of all of the energy from the previous cycle. It represents pure potential

    Many people dislike the winter season, as the weather is often harsh, cold and dark. However, the importance of this stage in the cycle cannot be overemphasied. Without this crucial time of death and rebirth, the other cycles would not be possible. We simply we would not have the energy or the perspective to enjoy them.

    Water energies are typically the deepest thinkers and "feelers" of the 9 Star Ki system. If the Fire element draws its strengths from the clarity of illumination, Water draws its wisdom from the power of feeling and inner knowing.
