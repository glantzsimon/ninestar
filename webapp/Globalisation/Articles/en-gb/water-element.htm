    The Water element is associated with winter and the night. It is the darkest stage of the cycle when things move into dormancy and stillness. It is a time of deep rest and regeneration as well as time for reflection and dreaming. The Water element is the result of the breakdown of all of the energy from the previous cycle. It represents pure potential

    Many people dislike the winter season, as the weather is often harsh, cold and dark. However, the importance of this stage in the cycle cannot be overemphasied. Without this crucial time of death and rebirth, the other cycles would not be possible. We simply we would not have the energy or the perspective to enjoy them.

    Water energies are typically the deepest thinkers and "feelers" of the 9 Star Ki system. If the Fire element draws its strengths from the clarity of illumination, Water draws its wisdom from the power of feeling and inner knowing.

    Water people can often appear as quiet, brooding and contemplative, like a deep lake or ocean. On the other hand, just like a bubbling mountain stream, Water people may also be lively and vivacious with a natural exploratory nature. Indeed, many famous explorers were born under this sign.

    Water is the element most associated with intuition and the emotions. Indeed, Water people are often very sensitive and intuitive and can make great counsellors.

    The Water element is associated with the kidneys and reproductive organs. Water energies often have a high sex drive and people may find them sexually attractive and alluring.

    Water needs a container, just as the river needs the river banks or the ocean needs the shore. Without this structure, Water energies may become too dispersed and chaotic.

    It is important for water energies to have their own space. They are often fiercely independent. Sometimes water energies can take this trait to the extreme and become loners or even hermits.
