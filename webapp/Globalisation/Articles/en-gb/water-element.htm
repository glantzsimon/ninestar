    The Water element is associated with winter and the night. It is the <strong>darkest stage of the cycle</strong> when things move into <strong>dormancy and stillness</strong>. It is a time of <strong>deep rest and regeneration</strong> as well as time for <strong>reflection and dreaming</strong>. The Water element is the result of the breakdown of all of the energy from the previous cycle. <strong>It represents pure potential</strong>.

    Many people dislike the winter season, as the weather is often harsh, cold and dark. However, the importance of this stage in the cycle cannot be overemphasied. Without this <strong>crucial time of death and rebirth</strong>, the other cycles would not be possible. We simply we would not have the energy or the perspective to enjoy them.

    Water Energies are typically the <strong>deepest thinkers and "feelers" of the 9 Star Ki system</strong>. If the Fire element draws its strengths from the clarity of illumination, <strong>Water draws its wisdom from the power of feeling and inner knowing</strong>.
