    1 Water Energies often have a profound sense of sexual energy
</h5>
<p>
    Of all the nine numbers, 1 VVater Energies tend to have the most profound sense of sexual energy. This is partly due to the fact that, in Chinese medicine, Water controls the function of the reproductive system.

<h5>
    Water can result in two very different outward expressions of sexual energy
</h5>
<p>
    Just as water in the natural world can be either fresh and effervescent like that of a stream, or deep, quiet and potentially stagnant like a pond, the sexual character of 1 Water energies can result in two rather different outward expressions: on the one hand reserved, cautious and indecisive about entering into a sexual relationship or, on the other: extremely passionate and flirtatious.
</p>
<h5>
    Water Energies often go through long periods of celibacy, but are usually very loyal once in a committed relationship
</h5>
<p>
    1 Water Energies may find themselves celibate for long periods of their lives and may well give the world the image of being a bit of a wallflower at times. Nevertheless, behind this rather cautious facade often lies a very strong sexual energy that is waiting to be expressed with the right person. Within the context of a secure relationship, Water Energies can be quite adventurous whilst at the same time deeply loyal.
</p>
<h5>
    Water Energies can also have a tendency towards spreading themselves too thinly
</h5>
<p>
    Just as water without a container, such as a glass or the banks of a river, simply flows in all directions, 1 Water energies may end up spreading themselves too thinly and enter multiple relationships at once or hop from one relationship to the next.
</p>
<h5>
    Secrets and fantasies
</h5>
<p>
    Water Energies can often be quite secretive and may have many sexual fantasies that they never express to their partners. It may even be hard for Water Energies' partners to fully understand them sexually and they can remain something of a mystery, which adds to their allure.
</p>
<h5>
    Water Energies often make empathetic and receptive partners
</h5>
<p>
    Of the 9 Energies, 1 Waters are perhaps the most empathetic. They have a great capacity to be receptive to their partner's needs, whist comunicating their own. This can create great harmony in their relationships.
