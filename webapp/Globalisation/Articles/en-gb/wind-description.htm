    The sensitivity and receptiveness to others displayed by Wind energies can make them great counsellors. On the other hand, these energies can also be gullible and easily influenced by or overly trusting of others.
    It may be wise for four energies to seek the council of others before making a long-term commitment to a project or relationship.
