    The sexual nature of 4 Tree
</p>
<p>
    The 4 Tree nature evokes the image ofthe full maturing of spring— the blossoming, dynamic force that we feel before the arrival of summer. 
    
    The corresponding element in the I Ching is Wind. 
    
    Here, your sexual nature can have all the dynamism symbolic of spring, combined with an emotional, changeable nature that is represented by the wind. 
    
    You have a deeply trusting nature which, in combination with your spontaneity and changeable nature, can make you very impulsive in a sexual relationship. 
    
    You can, for instance, be strongly attracted to someone and want to embark on a sexual relationship immediately. 
    
    In the same way that you have a deep sense of trust in others, you give out to others a sincere and trusting quality. It is not uncommon for 
    the 4 Tree to have experienced many relationships before finding satisfaction. The best advice is always to take time and ask your best friend for their opinion before you throw yourself into a new relationship. 
    
    It is also very important to have the support and trust of your partner.
