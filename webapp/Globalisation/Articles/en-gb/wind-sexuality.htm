    The sexual nature of 4 Tree Energies combines the blossoming, dynamic force of spring with the more changeable quality of wind. This means that they are typically rather expressive, forthcoming and romantic, on the one hand, but can be extremely changeable and even fickle on the other.

    The deeply trusting nature of Wind Energies, combined with their spontaneity, can result in their being overly impulsive in sexual relationships. They may find themselves having many different sexual partners, not all of whom might end up being necessarily appropriate choices, and it may be some time before they find one who meets their emotional and sexual needs.

    For 4 Trees, it is usually advisable to take the time to consider a new relationship prospect and to ask for the counsel of friends or loved ones if there is any shadow of a doubt.
