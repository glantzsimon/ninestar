    Fire energies are bestowed with great enlightenment and clarity and can often steer a path through troubled waters. They are often highly inspirational individuals who are
    often drawn to situations which require their brilliant capacity for bringing about change.

    Of all nine energies, 9 Fires are the most adept at and comfortable with communication, especially with regards to emotional and personal experiences. This quality coupled with a
    warm and passionate nature can make 9 fires especially suited to theatre and film.
</p>
<p>
    On the one hand, these individuals can be enlightened and liberal, but on the other they can be proud, vein and overly critical.

<p>
    Behind the strong, successful surface lies a more sensitive and insecure nature that may erupt when offended. However, these individuals are quick to forgive and forget.
</p>
<p>
    Like 1 Water energies, 9 Fires need their space and do not like to have it invaded. For this reason, they may, at times, keep people at arms' length.
</p>
<p>
    Despite having a great sense of clarity and ability to see the big picture, 9 Fires are not especially practical when it comes to everyday affairs, such as DIY or setting up electronic equipment.
</p>
<p>
    Fire energies often possess much flare and appearances are important to them. This can be seen in the great care they take in choosing clothing, the contents of their homes, etc. They may even
    judge others quite harshly if they appear slovenly, sloppy or lacking good manners.
</p>
<p>
    9 Fire energies are inspirational and unforgettable and the world would certainly be a much duller place without their uplifting and colourful nature.
