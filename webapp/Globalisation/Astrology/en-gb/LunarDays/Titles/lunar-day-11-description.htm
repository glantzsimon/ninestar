<h5>Day 11 – Waxing Gibbous</h5>
<p>
    The eleventh lunar day carries an immense charge of raw, primal energy. It is a day of strength, drive, and momentum—well-suited for decisive action and courageous undertakings. When harnessed consciously, this surge can be directed toward bold ventures, breakthroughs, or transformative experiences that require willpower and resilience. However, this energy can also become volatile if left unchecked, making it important to remain grounded and intentional in your actions.

    This is not a day for half-measures or timid steps. The cosmic current favors those willing to act with conviction and clarity. Physical activity, martial arts, leadership tasks, or creative efforts that demand bold expression are especially favored. Stay alert and avoid impulsive reactions, as emotional outbursts or recklessness can lead to missteps. Channel the fire into focused purpose, and you may experience powerful growth and insight.
