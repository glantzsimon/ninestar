<h5>Day 16 – Waning Gibbous</h5>
<p>
    The sixteenth lunar day ushers in a gentle descent from the heightened intensity of the Full Moon. It calls for balance, moderation, and grounding. This is a day of quiet integration—when the emotional peaks of the full moon begin to settle, allowing space for reflection and recalibration. It's an ideal time to examine recent insights, assess your accomplishments, and begin gently releasing what no longer serves you.

    Emotionally, this is a day of stability and harmony if you allow yourself to slow down and listen inwardly. Acts of generosity and gratitude carry particular strength now, helping to channel the moon’s lingering energy in peaceful and purposeful ways. Whether through journaling, light movement, or heartfelt conversations, use this day to realign your intentions and begin the conscious descent into the introspective half of the lunar cycle.
