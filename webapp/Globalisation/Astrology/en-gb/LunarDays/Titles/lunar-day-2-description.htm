<h5>Day 2 – Waxing Crescent</h5>
<p>
    The second day of the lunar cycle ushers in the first sliver of moonlight—a subtle but powerful sign that energy is beginning to rise. Like the first shoots breaking through the soil, this is a day of gentle momentum and growing clarity. It marks the earliest stage of manifestation, where ideas and intentions planted during the New Moon begin to stir into form. Though progress may still be quiet or unseen, there is a quickening beneath the surface that invites participation.

    This is a day for taking first steps and initiating what was only imagined before. Even the smallest actions hold meaning now, for they begin to define the path ahead. Focus on nurturing your intentions with care, building a foundation with patience and steady optimism. The light is growing—trust it to guide you forward.
