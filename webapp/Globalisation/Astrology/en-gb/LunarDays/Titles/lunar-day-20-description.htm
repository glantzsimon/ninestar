    This is an excellent time to commit to long-term transformation, especially if it involves breaking habits, releasing toxic patterns, or embracing a new path that aligns more deeply with your truth. Meditative practices, solitude, or even physical exertion can help channel this strong energy productively. Trust the process of change—what feels like loss or letting go may in fact be the key to your greater freedom.
