<h5>Day 25 – Waning Crescent</h5>
<p>
    The twenty-fifth lunar day is one of deep stillness and inward renewal. It’s a time to withdraw from the demands of the outer world and allow your body, mind, and spirit to rest. The Moon is approaching its final stages, and its quiet energy supports reflection, solitude, and reconnection with your inner sanctuary. Avoid overstimulation or busy schedules—this is a day to slow down and nourish yourself from within.

    Meditation, gentle movement, or simply sitting in silence can be incredibly restorative. Dreams may carry deeper meaning, and intuitive messages often come through more clearly in moments of calm. Let this day be a sacred pause in your month—a chance to empty the mind, soften the heart, and prepare for the cycle’s renewal just ahead.
