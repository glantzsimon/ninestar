<h5>Day 26 – Waning Crescent</h5>
<p>
    This is a day of heightened perception, often associated with deep insight and spiritual awareness. Emotions may run high, and sensitivity to subtle energies is amplified. It’s an ideal time for inner work, meditation, or solitary activities that promote self-reflection and peace. However, it's also important to avoid excess—particularly food, stimulation, or emotional drama—as the day carries a risk of emotional imbalance or illusion.
</p>
<p> Try to stay grounded, calm, and centered. This is a day when dreams and symbols carry significance, and intuitive insights may arise spontaneously if you make space for them. </p>
