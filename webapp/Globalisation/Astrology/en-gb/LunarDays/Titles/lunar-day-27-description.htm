It’s a day to attune yourself to beauty in all its forms—whether through art, music, poetry, or acts of kindness.

Synchronicities may occur more frequently, and gestures of forgiveness or compassion carry a special weight. Use this day to reconnect with what you love and value most. A peaceful spirit, an open heart, and a willingness to let beauty guide your steps will make the most of this luminous energy.
