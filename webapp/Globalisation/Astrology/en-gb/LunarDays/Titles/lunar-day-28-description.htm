<h5>Day 28 – Waning Crescent</h5>
<p>
    The energy of this day is soft, pure, and luminous—ideal for spiritual reflection and quiet integration. As the end of the lunar cycle nears, the 28th day offers clarity and wisdom if the earlier parts of the cycle have been lived with awareness. It's a good time to review your intentions from the new moon and see what has come full circle.
