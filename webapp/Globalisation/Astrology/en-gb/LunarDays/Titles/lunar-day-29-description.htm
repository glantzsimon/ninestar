<h5>Day 29 – Dark Moon</h5>
<p>
    This is traditionally seen as one of the most challenging days of the lunar cycle. The energies can feel heavy, deceptive, or disorienting, especially for those who are sensitive. It’s important to stay grounded, avoid making major decisions, and be wary of illusions or emotional manipulation—either from others or from within.

    If approached consciously, the 29th day can be a powerful teacher, revealing hidden fears or unconscious patterns. Gentle solitude and rest are recommended. Avoid conflict, excess, or negativity wherever possible.
