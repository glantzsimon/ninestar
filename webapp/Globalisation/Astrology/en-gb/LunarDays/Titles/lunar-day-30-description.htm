<h5>Day 30 – Dark Moon (only present in some months)</h5>
<p>
    The 30th lunar day is rare and doesn’t occur every lunar month. When it does appear, it is considered a day of grace, forgiveness, and renewal. It carries a deeply spiritual vibration—quiet, balanced, and harmonizing. This is a time to offer gratitude, release the past, and prepare for the next lunar cycle with a clean heart.

    Kindness, compassion, and meditation are key themes. It’s also a good time to tie up loose ends, perform acts of service, or offer prayers for the collective. The presence of this day is seen as a cosmic blessing.
