<h5>Day 7 – First Quarter</h5>
<p>
    As the Moon reaches its First Quarter, tension and momentum begin to build. This day brings a potent surge of mental clarity and focus, making it ideal for decision-making, planning, and intellectual endeavors. It is also a time when words hold exceptional creative and destructive power—what is spoken today has the potential to ripple outward and shape reality. For this reason, it is essential to communicate with intention, mindfulness, and integrity.

<p>
    This is a day for aligning speech with spirit. Avoid gossip or heated arguments, as their impact may be long-lasting. Instead, channel this potent mental energy into study, writing, or spiritual reflection. The First Quarter offers an energetic push to overcome internal resistance and continue manifesting intentions set during the New Moon. Trust your voice, but let it speak from a place of wisdom and compassion.
