<h5>New Moon {Illumination}</h5>
<p>
    The New Moon marks the quiet beginning of the lunar cycle—a moment of stillness, potential, and renewal. With the moon completely hidden from view, this is a time of introspection and inward turning, where dreams begin to stir in the fertile darkness. Just as seeds germinate beneath the soil, ideas, desires, and intentions take root in the invisible realms of thought and feeling. This is not a time for outward action, but for clarity and alignment.

    The energy of the New Moon invites us to pause, listen, and reconnect with our inner truth. It is an ideal moment to plant metaphorical seeds by setting intentions, visualising future paths, or simply holding space for what is yet to come. Though subtle, the New Moon holds great power—what begins in darkness can shape the entire cycle ahead.
