<h5>Day 10 – Waxing Gibbous {Illumination}</h5>
<p>
    The tenth lunar day is a time to honor your roots and reconnect with your foundation—both familial and spiritual. As the Moon swells with light, it illuminates the threads that bind you to your lineage, heritage, and the values passed down through generations. This is a favorable day for family gatherings, remembering ancestors, and tending to relationships that form your inner support system. Gratitude, humility, and remembrance deepen your connection to the past and help solidify your path forward.

    It’s also an excellent day to assess what kind of legacy you’re building. Are your actions today in harmony with the lineage you came from and the one you’re shaping for the future? Activities that nourish home life, foster belonging, or strengthen a sense of personal identity are especially powerful. In stillness or in conversation, you may find a subtle but profound sense of continuity and inner strength unfolding.
