<h5>Day 12 – Waxing Gibbous {Illumination}</h5>
<p>
    The twelfth lunar day is imbued with gentle, healing energy and encourages the flowering of compassion, empathy, and selflessness. It is a time to soften the ego and open the heart to others, making it ideal for charitable acts, service-oriented work, and quiet spiritual reflection. Emotional sensitivity is heightened, and many find themselves more naturally inclined toward forgiveness, reconciliation, and emotional generosity.

<p>
    This is a day for nurturing the soul through kindness—both given and received. Simple gestures of care can have a powerful ripple effect now. Whether through offering a helping hand, sharing words of comfort, or immersing yourself in meditative or devotional practices, you may find deep emotional fulfilment in giving without expectation. Avoid harsh conversations or overexertion, and instead, cultivate gentleness within and around you.
