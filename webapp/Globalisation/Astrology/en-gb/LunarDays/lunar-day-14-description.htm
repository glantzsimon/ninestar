<h5>Day 14 – Waxing Gibbous {Illumination}</h5>
<p>
    The fourteenth lunar day is charged with clarity and rising momentum, as the Moon nears its fullness. This is a time when intentions set earlier in the cycle begin to crystallize, and the energy available supports decisive action and meaningful progress. You may feel more focused, determined, and capable of taking concrete steps toward your goals. It’s an excellent day for refining your vision, solidifying plans, and following through with commitment and discipline.

<p>
    The energy is both expansive and stabilizing, making it a powerful day for goal-oriented work, communication, and collaboration. Trust your instincts, but remain grounded—this is a day for mature action, not impulsivity. Activities that align with personal integrity and higher purpose are especially favored now, as the light of the nearly full moon lends clarity to your path and brings greater awareness of what’s working—and what needs adjustment.
