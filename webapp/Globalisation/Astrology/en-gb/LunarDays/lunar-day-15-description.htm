<h5>Day 15 – Full Moon {Illumination}</h5>
<p>
    The Full Moon marks the peak of the lunar cycle—a time of culmination, illumination, and emotional intensity. Energy is at its highest, and everything feels amplified: our joys, our challenges, our desires. This is a powerful day for celebrating how far you've come, expressing gratitude for what has been achieved, and acknowledging the efforts that brought you here. Rituals, creative expression, and heartfelt connection flourish under this bright lunar light.

    The Full Moon also casts clarity on what has been hidden or overlooked, making it a potent time for insight and release. Emotions may run high, so it's important to remain centered and avoid reacting impulsively. Instead, use this heightened awareness to gain perspective, strengthen relationships, and realign with your deeper truth. Whatever is no longer serving you can now be seen clearly and gracefully let go.
