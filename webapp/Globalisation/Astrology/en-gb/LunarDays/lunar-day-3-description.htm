<h5>Day 3 – Waxing Crescent {Illumination}</h5>
<p>
    The third lunar day brings a surge of energy, often experienced as assertiveness, drive, or even internal tension. This is a time when the Moon’s light is visibly growing stronger, and with it comes a call to action. Challenges may arise—not necessarily from the outside, but from within—as a natural stirring of ambition, willpower, and desire for progress. The atmosphere is charged, and it favours boldness, movement, and the confrontation of obstacles.

    This is an ideal day for engaging in physical activity, tackling demanding tasks, or defending your personal boundaries—both literal and emotional. Passive behaviour may feel uncomfortable now, and those who shy away from action might experience a sense of vulnerability or frustration. The key is to channel this fiery energy into focused, intentional movement. Be brave. Take initiative. Today, struggle is not a setback—it’s part of the momentum building toward achievement.
