<h5>Day 8 – First Quarter {Illumination}</h5>
<p>
    The energy of the eighth lunar day is deeply transformative, offering a sacred opportunity for renewal and inner purification. As the Moon continues its ascent, this is a time to shed outdated beliefs, habits, or emotional patterns that no longer serve your growth. Through reflection and honest self-inquiry, we gain clarity on what must be released in order to evolve. Acts of repentance or forgiveness—toward oneself or others—can have a powerful healing effect today.

    This day invites courage and humility. Just as the Moon grows brighter, we too are asked to bring light to our shadows and begin anew with sincerity and purpose. Whether through ritual, meditation, or quiet contemplation, embrace the process of letting go. Transformation often begins with a single step inward—and today, the cosmos supports you in taking it.
