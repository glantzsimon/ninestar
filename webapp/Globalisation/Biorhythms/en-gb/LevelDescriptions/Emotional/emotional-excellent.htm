    Your emotional capacity is at the maximum point of the cycle. You have excellent reserves of emotional energy and is the best time to deal with more emotionally challenging situations, if you have been unable to face them when your emotional energy was lower.

    Now is an excellent time to reach out to loved ones who may need your emotional support. However, don't forget to find some alone time and to rest! It's always good to keep some energy for the lower points. This stabilises the cycle.
