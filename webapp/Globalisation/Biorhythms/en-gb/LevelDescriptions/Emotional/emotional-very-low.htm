    Your emotional capacity is currently very low for this cycle. It can be very helpful to take plenty of rest and not to take on anything too emotionally challenging during this period. You may feel vulnerable or hyper sensitive at this time or that you simply don't have a lot of emotional capacity. Be gentle with yourself.

    Now is a great time to meditate, practise Asana, go for Nature walks, listen to some beautiful music, get a massage, watch an inspiring movie, or whatever helps you to relax and unwind. Passive activities, like reading or watching a film, are highly beneficial during this part of the cycle.

    If you are someone who is prone to depression, anxiety or other mental health challenges, it's especially important to take care of yourself and to take care of your emotional wellbeing. If it's possible to avoid or limit exposure to known stressors, that would be ideal. If you are feeling low, there are a number of natural remedies that can support low mood and cognitive function, such as Saint John's wort, skullcap, Gingko biloba, Mucuna pruriens, Rhodiola rosea, Ashwagandha and Brahmi. However, nothing is more important than adequate rest.
