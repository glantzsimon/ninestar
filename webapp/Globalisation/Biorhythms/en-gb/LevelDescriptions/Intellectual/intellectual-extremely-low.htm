    If you are someone who is prone to depression, anxiety or other mental health challenges, it's especially important to take care of yourself and not overdo it mentally during this period. If you are feeling low, there are a number of natural remedies that can support low mood and cognitive function, such as Saint John's wort, skullcap, Gingko biloba, Mucuna pruriens, Rhodiola rosea, Ashwagandha and Brahmi.
