    Your intellectual capacity is currently very high. You have very good reserves of mental energy and can sustain hard work easily. However, even when biorhythms are high, it's wise not to push it too hard. Rest is always important.

    You should have plenty of energy, clarity and motivation to tend to work and to your responsibilities. It's also a great time to challenge yourself and learn new things and expand your perspectives and awareness. Don't forget to take a break from time to time.
