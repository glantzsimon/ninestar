    Your physical energy is currently at the maximum point of the cycle. You have excellent reserves of physical energy and it is a great time to deal with more physically challenging tasks, if you have been unable to carty them out when your energy was lower.

    Now is also an excellent time to enjoy vigorous exercise and to challenge yourself.. However, don't forget to find some alone time and to rest! It's always good to keep some energy for the lower points. This stabilises the cycle.
