    Your physical energy is low for the current cycle. It can be very helpful to take plenty of breaks and not to take on anything too physically challenging during this period, especially if you are feeling tired. Be gentle with yourself and get plenty of rest.

    Now is a great time to catch up on sleep, to eat nourishing food, meditate, go for gentle Nature walks, listen to some beautiful music, get a massage, watch an inspiring movie, or whatever helps you to relax and unwind. Passive activities, like reading or watching a film, are highly beneficial during this part of the cycle. Gentle exercise can also be beneficial, but if you are feeling tired, it's better to listen to the body.
