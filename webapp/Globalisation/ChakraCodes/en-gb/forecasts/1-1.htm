        Challenges in Social Connections and Potential Conflicts Later On

</h3>
<p>
    The dominant energy influencing this period is centered around social relationships (2), making interactions with others a primary focus. However, the counteracting force arises from the assertive energy of the solar plexus (3), which amplifies personal opinions and strong-willed attitudes. This dynamic may lead to friction, as there is a tendency to prioritize individual perspectives over adaptability. As a result, misunderstandings, disagreements, or even conflicts could surface, particularly in the latter half of the period. Practicing patience and open-mindedness will be essential to navigating these social tensions effectively.
