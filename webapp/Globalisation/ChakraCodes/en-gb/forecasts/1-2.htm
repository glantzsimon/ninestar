    <strong>
        Emotional Turbulence and Challenges Ahead – Avoid Overextending
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    During this period, the relentless momentum of dynamic energy (3) is hindered or disrupted by the introspective nature of intuition and karmic influences (4). This creates a misalignment between action and emotion, leading to inner tension and uncertainty. The push to move forward is met with hesitation, self-doubt, or unforeseen obstacles, making it difficult to maintain focus and direction. Overextending yourself during this time could amplify stress and increase the likelihood of setbacks. As the period progresses, the risk of failure grows, emphasizing the importance of patience, self-awareness, and careful decision-making.
