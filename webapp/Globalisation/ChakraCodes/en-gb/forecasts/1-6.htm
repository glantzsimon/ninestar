        A Fortunate Cycle – Financial Shifts and Unexpected Gains  
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This period carries a promising energy, though it may begin with financial constraints or a sense of limitation. The first half requires patience and trust, as resources might feel stretched or delayed. However, as time progresses, the tide turns in your favor, bringing financial relief in the form of inheritance, income, or long-overdue payments. The reflective and waiting energy (7) encourages faith in the process, fostering an inner knowing that things will align as they should. As the cycle shifts into the second half, the incoming flow of abundance and reward (8) manifests, reinforcing the idea that persistence and patience lead to tangible benefits. Additionally, nature plays a role in this phase, whether through literal gifts from the earth or symbolic renewal and prosperity.
