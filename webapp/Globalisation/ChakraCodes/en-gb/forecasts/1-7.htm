    The rewards, or lack thereof, for whatever you have been working on are apparent (8). We can see what we get and there is a contemplative view (9). Previous actions measure/reflect how abundant the funds coming in are/were. A good time for  analysing previous actions: what worked and what didn’t, and how it has earned you this reward.
