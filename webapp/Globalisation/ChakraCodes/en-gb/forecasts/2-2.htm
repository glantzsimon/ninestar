    <strong>
        A Period of Tests and Concerns – Thoughtful Decisions Required  
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This phase may bring challenges that test patience and clarity, particularly in areas requiring careful decision-making. Emotional awareness (4) plays a crucial role, as intuition provides valuable insights that should not be overlooked. Before making logical or analytical choices (6), take the time to reflect deeply and ensure that both intellect and intuition are in harmony. Paying close attention to details and considering all perspectives will help maintain balance and prevent rushed or ungrounded decisions. By approaching this period with mindfulness and careful contemplation, you can navigate complexities with greater confidence and wisdom.
