    <strong>
        A Time for Guidance – Wisdom, Reflection, and Emotional Balance  
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This period presents an opportunity to seek insight from both spiritual and material advisors. Engaging in thoughtful discussions and carefully considering advice from trusted associates is essential (2), as the right guidance can provide valuable clarity and direction. Deep philosophical conversations (9) are particularly meaningful during this time, offering new perspectives and helping to align thoughts with higher wisdom. However, if unresolved matters linger, emotions may intensify, creating inner tension or restlessness. Balancing intellectual reflection with physical movement—such as hatha yoga, running, or other grounding activities—can help maintain harmony and ensure that contemplation translates into positive action. This is a moment to listen, reflect, and integrate knowledge while staying mindful of both the mind and body.
