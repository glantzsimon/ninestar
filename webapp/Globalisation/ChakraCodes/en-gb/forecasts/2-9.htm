    <strong>
        A Challenging Period – Tensions in Relationships and Emotional Clarity  
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This phase may bring interpersonal challenges, making it a testing time for relationships and associations. Communication could be strained, and misunderstandings may arise, leading to quarrels or emotional friction. Rather than engaging in reactive discussions, it might be more beneficial to express your thoughts through writing (2), allowing for greater clarity and emotional processing before addressing conflicts directly. Be mindful that subconscious influences may color your words, potentially distorting your true intentions. Your intuitive sense of people and situations (4) is likely to be sharper than what is being outwardly expressed, making it important to trust your inner awareness while navigating interactions with care. Approach this period with patience and introspection to avoid unnecessary disputes and gain deeper emotional understanding.
