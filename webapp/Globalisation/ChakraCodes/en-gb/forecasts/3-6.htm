    <strong>
        An Emotionally Intense Period – Potential Loss, Disappointment, and Nervous Strain  
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This phase is marked by heightened emotions, making it a challenging time for relationships and personal stability. There may be feelings of disappointment, the potential for losing friendships, or situations that place strain on the nervous system. The strong urge to take action (3) may lead to impulsive or inappropriate decisions, which could further escalate tension. Instead of reacting hastily, this is a time for deep contemplation and gaining insight. Allow your vision and perspective to shift naturally, but refrain from making significant changes or decisions until the next cycle (9), when clarity and stability will be more fully restored. Practicing mindfulness and self-care will help navigate this emotionally charged period with greater balance and resilience.
