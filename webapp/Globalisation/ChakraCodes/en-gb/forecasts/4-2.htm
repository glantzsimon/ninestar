        New Beginnings in Family, Community, and Institutional Matters – A Time for Stability and Growth  
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This period supports new beginnings, whether within your immediate family, a broader spiritual community, or collaborative efforts related to institutions. It is an ideal time to initiate projects with like-minded individuals (1), as shared values and collective goals provide a strong foundation for success. Communication flows easily, fostering deeper understanding and allowing for a comprehensive vision of the bigger picture (6). Decisions made during this time are likely to be stable and well-grounded, making it a favorable phase for long-term commitments, structured planning, and laying the groundwork for future growth. By embracing both personal and collective responsibility, this cycle offers an opportunity to build lasting connections and meaningful contributions.
