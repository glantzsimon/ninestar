        A Challenging Start Leading to Success – Reflection, Nature, and Future Growth  
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This period may begin with difficulties, requiring patience, introspection, and a quiet, spiritual approach. The best way to navigate the early phase is through meditation and deep reflection, ideally in a natural setting where clarity and inspiration can emerge (7). By tuning into universal wisdom and allowing insights to unfold organically, a sense of inner peace and direction will develop. As the cycle progresses, connections with others will become more effortless, and shared experiences will bring new opportunities and positive outcomes (2). Though the start may feel slow or uncertain, trust that this phase is laying the foundation for a beneficial and rewarding conclusion.
