        Disappointment, often financially if over extended; money in first half, money out second half.

<p>
    First half dynamic and optimistic (3), good time to do and gain but do so early; last half should become more introverted - going inward to feel what is really going on in the heart center. Be thankful for what is gained in the first half of the cycle but drop expectations (8).
