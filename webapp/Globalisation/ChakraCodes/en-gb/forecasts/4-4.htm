    <strong>
        A Period of Financial Fluctuations – Gain Early, Reflect Later  
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This cycle brings a mix of financial opportunities and potential setbacks, making timing crucial. The first half is dynamic and optimistic (3), offering a favorable window for action, earning, and seizing opportunities. However, it is important to make the most of this phase early, as the second half of the period shifts inward, requiring greater introspection and emotional awareness. As momentum slows, turning attention to the heart center and evaluating deeper motivations will be essential. Express gratitude for the gains made in the earlier part of the cycle, but release attachment to outcomes (8). By balancing ambition with mindfulness, you can navigate this period with greater ease and avoid unnecessary disappointment.
