    <strong>
        A Period of Reflection and Release – Emotional Challenges and Inner Reorganization  
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This phase is a test of emotional resilience and nervous system stability, making it essential to slow down and prioritize self-care. It is a deeply introspective time, encouraging you to examine your true feelings and reassess personal relationships (4). Loss or distance from family and friends may bring a sense of solitude, but this can also serve as an opportunity for healing and clarity. Embracing silence and seeking connection with higher guidance can provide valuable insights. Journaling and reflecting on the purity of your motives will help in realigning your inner world. This is a period for cleansing—both mentally and physically—where letting go of what no longer serves you is key. Rather than taking ambitious action, focus on acts of service and compassion (9), as giving to others will bring balance and renewal to your own journey.
