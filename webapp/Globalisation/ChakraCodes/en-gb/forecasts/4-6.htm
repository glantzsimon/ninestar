    <strong>
        A Time of Rapid Expansion – New Ideas, Bold Beginnings, and Caution in Action  
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This period is filled with excitement and forward momentum, making it an ideal time for generating fresh ideas and launching new projects. Inspiration flows abundantly, and the energy is strong for taking the first steps toward implementation (1). Seeds of opportunity planted now may begin to sprout sooner than expected, signaling early progress. However, with this surge of enthusiasm, the mind may race ahead of the body (5), creating a tendency for impulsive decisions or missteps. While expansion is encouraged, it is essential to stay present and mindful to avoid unnecessary accidents or setbacks. By balancing creative vision with measured action, you can make the most of this dynamic and fast-paced phase.
