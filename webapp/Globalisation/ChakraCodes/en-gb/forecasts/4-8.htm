    <strong>
        A Cycle of Shifting Energy – From Overconfidence to Reflection and Expression  
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This period begins with a surge of dynamic and extroverted energy (3), driving action and a sense of enthusiasm. However, there is a risk of over-optimism, which, if unchecked, may lead to disappointment or setbacks. As the cycle progresses, the energy shifts inward, transitioning into a more contemplative and introspective phase (7). This shift may bring feelings of tension or negativity, but it also offers a valuable opportunity for self-reflection and deeper spiritual insight. Rather than forcing external action, this is a time to observe, process, and channel thoughts into writing or self-study—Swadhyaya, the practice of self-inquiry. By embracing this reflective period, creative and personal growth can emerge, providing clarity and direction for the next cycle.
