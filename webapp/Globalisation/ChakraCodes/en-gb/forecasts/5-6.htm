        A Period of Introversion and Gradual Progress – Avoid Procrastination, Embrace Natural Flow  
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This phase begins with a relaxed and social energy (2), making it a good time for lighthearted interactions and casual gatherings. However, there is also a tendency toward procrastination or hesitation, so it is important to remain mindful of any delays in taking action. As the cycle progresses, inspiration begins to build, and a more active mental energy emerges (7). The latter half of this period brings opportunities for beneficial settlements and meaningful collaborations, making it an ideal time to solidify associations and gain clarity on important matters. Spending time in nature can be especially grounding and restorative during this phase, helping to balance introspection with gentle momentum toward progress.
