    <strong>
        A Time for Careful Decisions – Reflection, Inner Stability, and Nervous System Balance  
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This period calls for deep contemplation and careful decision-making, as it may serve as a test for emotional resilience and nervous system stability. It is best to remain inwardly focused and avoid unnecessary external action, except for selfless service through Karma Yoga—acting without expectation of reward (4). This is a powerful time for gaining insights from past experiences and healing through alignment with universal energies (9). By staying centered and allowing space for quiet reflection, you can process emotions, restore balance, and emerge with greater clarity for the path ahead. Prioritizing rest and solitude will ensure that this phase is a time of renewal rather than stress.
