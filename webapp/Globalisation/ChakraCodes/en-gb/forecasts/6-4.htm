    <strong>
        A Rest Period with Subtle Drive – Reflection, Planning, and Gradual Action  
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This phase feels like a time for rest and rejuvenation, yet there is a subtle drive to engage in physical activity or material pursuits (1). While the urge to act may be present, it is important to balance this with introspection and thoughtful planning. The first half of the period is ideal for reflection and strategizing, laying the groundwork for future actions. In the latter half, you can begin to implement those plans, ensuring that each step is taken with a clear sense of purpose and a thorough understanding of the overall goal (7). While this may be a time of rest, it is also an opportunity to prepare for future success through careful thought and measured action.
