        A Phase of Disappointment – Overextension and Emotional Strain in Family Decisions  
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This period starts with high energy and enthusiasm, which can easily lead to over-optimism and overextension (3). While the initial surge of activity may feel promising, it is important to recognize that the latter half of this phase will shift into a more introverted, non-active time. As the energy slows, emotional tensions may rise, potentially leading to disappointment in family-related decisions and a strain on friendships. It’s crucial to adjust expectations and avoid making major commitments during this time. The second half is ideal for planning and reassessment (6), allowing you to reflect on what has transpired and recalibrate your approach. By embracing this period of introspection, you can navigate challenges with greater wisdom and avoid unnecessary emotional setbacks.
