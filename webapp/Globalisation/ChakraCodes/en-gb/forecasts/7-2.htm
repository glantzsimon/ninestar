    <strong>
        A Strong Spiritual Period – Wisdom, Reflection, and Rest  
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This is a deeply spiritual period, offering a powerful opportunity for introspection and growth. The first half of this cycle is a time for rest and inner reflection, providing the space needed to recharge and gain clarity. Use this time to look inward and gain an overview of your life, drawing on spiritual insights (7) to understand your path. It’s an excellent moment to review the lessons learned over the last nine cycles from an evolutionary perspective, seeing how far you’ve come and where you’re heading. This phase also invites deeper meditation and a focus on reaching higher consciousness (9). By embracing quiet contemplation, you can tap into profound wisdom and align more closely with your spiritual journey.
