    <strong>
        A Test Phase – Family Challenges and Financial Caution  
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This period may bring challenges or crises within the family or close-knit groups, making it a time to pause and reflect rather than take immediate action. It’s a good moment to analyze family dynamics or group activities, paying close attention to underlying issues. Take time to contemplate, allowing intuition to rise quietly (6). Trust your feelings and observations (4), as they will provide valuable insights. Rather than rushing into decisions, breathe deeply and remain still, watching for the subtle signs that will help you prepare for what’s coming. By staying grounded and receptive, you can navigate this test phase with clarity and awareness, ensuring you are ready for any changes that arise.
