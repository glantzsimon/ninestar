    <strong>
        A Period of Spiritual and Mental Conflict – Embrace Calm and Observe Change  
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This period may bring internal spiritual and mental conflicts, potentially affecting your physical health, especially the heart and lungs. It is important to remain calm and simply observe the many inspirations that come your way in the first half, rather than acting on them impulsively. Allow your mind to clear, taking time to reflect and avoid rushing into decisions or actions (7). This is a positive time to reconnect with nature, finding peace and grounding in its presence, while doing little planning. In the second half, the energy shifts and becomes much more active, presenting opportunities for rewarding actions and accomplishments (5). By embracing the quiet introspection of the first half, you’ll be better prepared for the more dynamic and fulfilling phase that follows.
