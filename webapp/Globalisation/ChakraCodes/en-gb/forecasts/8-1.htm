        A Time for Financial Settlement and the Risk of Overspending; Spirituality May Call for Supporting Others
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This is a moment for deep contemplation, one that holds great potential for personal growth and connection (8). You may find yourself feeling profoundly aligned with the universe, sensing the divine presence around you (9). On a material level, everything seems to be falling into place, and you may feel a reassuring sense that the universe is supporting your journey. However, be mindful of the temptation to overspend, as this could disrupt the harmony you're experiencing. Additionally, this time might also bring a call to spiritually support others, requiring you to balance your own well-being with the needs of those around you.
