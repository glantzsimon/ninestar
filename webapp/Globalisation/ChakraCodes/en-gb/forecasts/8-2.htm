    <strong>
        A Time of Completion: Resist the Urge to Begin Something New Prematurely; Focus on Tying Up Loose Ends
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This is a period to bring closure to your current endeavors before diving into new projects. Take the time to reflect and plan thoughtfully for what's ahead (1). Approaching the next phase with a spiritual perspective—considering the broader benefits for everyone involved—will set a strong foundation for success (9). By tying up loose ends and ensuring a sense of completion, you prepare yourself for a more harmonious and effective future.
