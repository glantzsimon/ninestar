        A Time for Sage Advice: Seek the Cooperation of Trusted Associates; Positive Influence for Action, Though the Mind May Be Uncertain
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This is a powerful time for social engagement (1), where making meaningful connections and launching collaborative projects (2) are favored. It’s an ideal moment to seek the wisdom of those with experience, particularly from trusted associates who can offer valuable guidance. While there’s a strong push toward positive action and looking up, there may be a sense of uncertainty in your thoughts. Remember to remain open to the lessons others have to offer, recognizing that the divine can shine through many different voices and perspectives.
