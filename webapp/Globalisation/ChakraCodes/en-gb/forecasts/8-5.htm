        A Period of Conflict: Stay On Guard and Be Prepared for Disappointment in Social Matters
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This period calls for a more introspective approach, offering a quiet space ideal for healing (4). While there may be an urge to take action (3), it’s best to channel your efforts into areas of healing and personal growth. Sensitivity is heightened, so use this awareness to expand your understanding rather than reacting impulsively. It’s a positive time for nurturing your intuition and allowing it to guide you through challenges, helping you navigate this period with greater insight.
