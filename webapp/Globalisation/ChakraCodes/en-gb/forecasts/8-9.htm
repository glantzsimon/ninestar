    <strong>
        A Good Period: Unsettled in the First Half, Financial Gains in the Second Half
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This is a rewarding period, with the first half focused on receiving with gratitude, and the second half bringing financial gains, almost as if by luck or divine timing (8). It’s an excellent time to make purchases you’ve been wanting or seeking. In the spiritual cycles, this is also a wonderful time to experience a sense of universal bliss, as if by grace (7), bringing a deeper sense of connection and fulfillment.
