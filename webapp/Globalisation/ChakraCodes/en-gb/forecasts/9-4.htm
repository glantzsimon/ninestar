    <strong>
        A Time for Strict Attention to Detail: Focus on Routine and Avoid Anything Unusual or Difficult
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This is a period for careful attention to detail and thoroughness, particularly in any tasks or tests you may face. It’s not a time to take on unusual challenges or difficult undertakings. Instead, focus on cleansing—both physically, by nurturing your body, and mentally, by clearing negative thoughts and emotions. This is also a time for service and compassionate healing, where you can contribute to the well-being of others while fostering your own growth and clarity.
