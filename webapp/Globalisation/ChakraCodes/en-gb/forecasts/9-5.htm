        Time of tremendous positivity. Get out and get things done. Re-sow-remending period.

    Watch procrastination, as there might be too many ideas to deal with and the subsequent tendency to just dream about the possibilities. Time to express and layout some plans at least; be realistic about what can be done and allow the wisdom of the next cycle to make decisions.
