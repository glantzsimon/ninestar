    Both the Fundamental and Character Energies are Yang. This could lead to increased conflict as Yang Energies tend to be more confrontational than Yin Energies. On the other hand, as both Energies are Yang, it is likely that they will understand each other quite well, especially if the Elements are either in a <a target="_blank" href="{SameTransformation}">Sibling Transformation</a> or a <a target="_blank" href="{SupportiveTransformation}">Supportive Transformation</a>.

    In romantic relationships, this combination typically leads to <strong>less chemistry</strong> than with a Yin and Yang combination. Initially there may be a strong connection, but it is likely to fizzle out fairly quickly.

However, if the Elements are in a <a target="_blank" href="{ChallengingTransformation}">Challenging Transformation</a>, this may be less of an issue.
