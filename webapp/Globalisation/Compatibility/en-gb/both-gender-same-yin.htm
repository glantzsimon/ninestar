    Both the Fundamental and Emotional Energies are Yin. In the absence of Yang, there could be a breakdown in communication and the relationship could become stagnant. On the other hand, as both Energies are Yin, it is likely that they will understand each other quite well, especially if the Elements are either in a <a target="_blank" href="{SameTransformation}">Sibling Transformation</a> or a <a target="_blank" href="{SupportiveTransformation}">Supportive Transformation</a>.

Initially there may be a strong connection, but it is likely to fizzle out fairly quickly. Essentially, what typically happens is that the relationship stagnates in the absence of Yang. However, if the Elements are in a <a target="_blank" href="{ChallengingTransformation}">Challenging Transformation</a>, this may be less of an issue.
