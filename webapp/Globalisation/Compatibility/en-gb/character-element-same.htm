<h5>
    Same Element - Sibling Relationship
</h5>
<p>
    The Character Energies have the same element. There is a potential for a <strong>deep emotional connection</strong> as well as a very good <strong>mutual understanding on an emotional level</strong>. This can help to create more harmony in the relationship, especially if the fundamental Energies are antagonistic.
</p>
<p>
    In romantic relationships, sharing the same Character Energy element can lead to less chemistry or spark. However, if the other Energies are in a Supportive or Antagonistic Transformation then the chemistry may very well be more noticeable.
