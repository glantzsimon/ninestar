<h5>
    Character Energies - Same Enegetic Gender
</h5>
<p>
    In romantic relationships, this typically leads to <strong>less sexual chemistry</strong> than with opposite Character Energy genders. However, if the Fundamental Energies have opposite gender and antagonistic elements, the chance of sexual chemistry is far greater. Having the same Character Energy gender can lead to <strong>greater mutual understanding on an emotional level</strong>.
