    This has the potential to be a very harmonious combination. However, it might be better suited to friendship than romance.

<h5>
    Strengths
</h5>
<p>
    Both people share the same Fundamental Energy "Water". Water is perhaps the most intuitive and empathetic of the 9 Energies and so there is a potential for an extremely deep and intuitive connection between these two people. 
</p>
<p>
    Water Energy is naturally flexible, easy-going and generally non-confrontational, so this connection is likely to be quite harmonious with little conflict or misunderstandings.
</p>
<h5>
    Challenges
</h5>
<p>
    Water Energies do their own space and can be quite intoverted and withdrawn at times. Therefore, there is a risk that, over time, this quality could create distance in the relationship.
</p>
<p>
    Another potential drawback is that, when spending a lot of time together, there could be a tendency to exacerbate some of the more challenging aspects of Water Energies, such as being chaotic and undisciplined or lacking structure and boundaries.
</p>
<p>
    As both Energies share the same Fundamental Energy, there are generally many more similarities between them, which can lead to decreased magnetism and potential for challenge and growth.
