<h5>
    This is potentially quite a challenging combination, as the Fundamental Energies are in a Challenging Transformation, with {Person2} overriding or controlling {Person1}. However, there is a potential for good relationships chemistry and for growth.
</h5>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} is a 1 Water Energy and is likely to be quite free-spirited and independent with a go-with-the-flow kind of attitude to life. {Person2Proper}, on the other hand, is a Soil Energy and is more likely to be structured and disciplined. This could be perceieved as overly rigid by {Person1}. 
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand, {Person2}'s steady, pragmatic nature could equally be very beneficial to {Person1}, providing structure. Water, without a container, can become chaotic and undisciplined.
</p>
<p>
    Conversely, {Person1} can help {Person2} to loosen up and be less rigid; to flow more, like Water. This can be immensely helpful to Earth Energies, who sometimes need to be reminded to let their hair down and have more fun.
</p>
<p>
    Both Energies can express a sensitive, diplomatic side and this favours healthy communication between them.
</p>
<p>
    However, {Person1}'s need for independence and lots of space could trigger {Person2}'s tendency towards codependency and neediness, creating possible relationship tension. Nevertheless, Water is naturally empathetic and receptive and so any relationship conflict is likely to be resolved fairly easily.
</p>
<p>
    There is a higher than average risk of conflict and misunderstanding, owing to the challenging nature of this combination.
</p>
<p>
    The sexual chemistry between these two could very well be quite strong, given the antagonistic nature of the relationship, plus the fact that {Person1}'s energetic 'gender' is opposite {Person2}. However, due to the higher risk of conflict in this kind of combination, it may be challenging to establish a healthy, long-term romantic relationship. If couples do succeed in making this type of combination work, it often ends up being an incredibly strong, lifelong bond.
