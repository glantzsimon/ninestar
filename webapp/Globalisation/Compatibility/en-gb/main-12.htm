    This is potentially quite a challenging combination, as the Fundamental Energies are in a Challenging Transformation, with {Person2} overriding or controlling {Person1}. However, there is a potential for good relationship chemistry and for personal growth.

<h5>
    Challenges
</h5>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} and {Person2} are in a Challenging Transformation, with {Person2} challenging or controlling {Person1}. This can increase the likelihood of conflict and misunderstandings. The challenging Energy ({Person2}) needs to take care not to become overly controlling.
</p>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} is a 1 Water Energy and is likely to be quite free-spirited and independent with a go-with-the-flow kind of attitude to life. {Person2Proper}, on the other hand, is a Soil Energy and is more likely to be structured and disciplined. This could be perceieved as overly rigid by {Person1}.
</p>
<p>
    {Person2Proper} could be too much structured and rigid for {Person1}, making {Gender1Pronoun} feel overly restricted and caged in.
</p>
<p>
    The risk of {Person1} feeling restricted can also apply to the way in which these two people communicate. A common issue with this combination is that the Water Energy finds the Earth's thinking overly rational and lacking flexibilty and subtlety. They may find that their ideas are too frequently contradicted or dismissed and the Earth Energy may find it hard to fully relate to the deeper, more intuitive Water nature.
</p>
<p>
    {Person1Proper}'s need for independence and lots of space could trigger {Person2}'s tendency towards codependency and neediness, creating possible relationship tension.
</p>

<h5>
    Strengths
</h5>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} can help {Person2} to loosen up and be less rigid; to flow more, like Water. This can be immensely helpful to Earth Energies, who sometimes need to be reminded to let their hair down and have more fun.
</p>
<p>
    {Person2Proper}'s steady, pragmatic nature could equally be very beneficial to {Person1}, providing structure. Water, without a container, can become chaotic and undisciplined.
</p>
<p>
    Both Energies can express a sensitive, diplomatic side and this favours healthy communication between them.
</p>
<p>
    Water Energies are naturally empathetic and receptive, making any relationship conflict easier to resolve.
</p>

<h5>
    Final Thoughts
</h5>
<p>
    There is a higher than average risk of conflict and misunderstanding, owing to the challenging nature of this combination. However, Water energies tend to be some of the most flexible and accomodating of the 9 Star Ki system, and so this is less of an issue than it might be in other antagonistic combinations.
