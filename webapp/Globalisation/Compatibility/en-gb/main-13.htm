    This is potentially quite an exciting and harmonious combination, as the Fundamental Energies are in a Supportive Transformation, with {Person1} supporting {Person2}. There is also potential for good relationships chemistry and for growth.

<p>
    {Person1Proper} is a 1 Water Energy and is likely to be quite free-spirited and independent with a go-with-the-flow kind of attitude to life. 
    
    {Person2Proper} is a Thunder Energy. Thunders often share the flexible, free-spirited and spontaneous nature of Waters and the combination of these two Energies can be electric, fun, dynamic and invigorating. Water Energies seem to really love Thunder Energies. They are possibly their favourite Energy of the 9 Star Ki system. 
</p>
<p>
    {Person2Proper} can be impulsive and unpredictable, which can sometimes pose problems in other combinations. However, {Person1}'s flexible nature is more able than any of the other Energies to embrace and support this tendency. 
</p>
<p>
    This combination can result in a lot of growth and exploration. It is a great combination, both romantically, as friends and also at the work place.
</p>
<p>
    Water Energies are generally more pragmatic and grounded than 3 Trees. Combined with their great tact and diplomacy, this can exert a balancing and calming effect on Thunder Energies.
</p>
<p>
    Conversely, Thunder Energies, with their boundless energy and sense of purpose, can help provide clear direction and purpose to Water Energies, who can sometimes lose their way.

<p>
    In a Supportive Transformation or Parent / Child relationship, the supported Energy (in this case {Person2}) needs to take care not to take the 'parent' for granted. If an imbalance starts to appear, the parent Energy may grow resentful and pull away.
</p>
<p>
    Generally speaking, this is a very harmonious combination, with great potential for fun, exploration as well as growth and mutual support and learning.
</p>
<p>
    The sexual chemistry between these two can be quie strong as, although they are both Yang Energies, they belong to different Modalities and both Water and Thunder are generally very sexual. This combination is ideal for establishing a healthy, long-term romantic relationship. It could easily lead to a deep, lifelong bond.
