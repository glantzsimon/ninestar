    This is potentially quite an exciting and harmonious combination. There is also potential for good relationship chemistry and for personal growth.

<h5>
    Strengths
</h5>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} and {Person2} are in a Supportive Transformation, with {Person1} supporting {Person2}. This type of combination typically leads to greater harmony and mutual understanding.
</p>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} is a 1 Water Energy and is likely to be quite free-spirited and independent with a go-with-the-flow kind of attitude to life.

    {Person2Proper} is a Wind Energy. Winds often share the flexible, free-spirited and spontaneous nature of Waters and the combination of these two Energies can be electric, fun, dynamic and invigorating. Water Energies generally appreciate the flexible, open and thoughtful nature of Winds.
</p>
<p>
    This combination can result in a lot of growth and exploration. It is a great combination, both romantically, as friends and also at the work place.
</p>
<p>
    Both Water Energies and 4 Trees are generally fairly pragmatic, grounded and thoughtful. There is a high potential for great communication and relationship harmony with this combination.
</p>
<p>
    Wind Energies often have a strong sense of direction and purpose, especially when inspired. This can be especially helpful to Water Energies, who can sometimes lose their way and become a bit scattered or chaotic.
</p>

<h5>
    Challenges
</h5>
<p>
    {Person2Proper} can be impulsive and unpredictable, which can sometimes be the cause of some friction in the relationship. However, {Person1}'s flexible nature is more able than any of the other Energies to embrace and support this tendency.
</p>
<p>
    In a Supportive Transformation or Parent / Child relationship, the supported Energy (in this case {Person2}) needs to take care not to take the 'parent' for granted. If an imbalance starts to appear, the parent Energy may grow resentful and pull away. However, 4 Trees, unlike Thunder Energies, tend to be very thoughtful and aware of others, so there is less of a risk of that happening in this combination.
</p>

<h5>
    Final Thoughts
</h5>
<p>
    Generally speaking, this is a very harmonious combination, with great potential for fun, exploration as well as growth and mutual support and learning.
