    This is potentially quite a tricky combination, as the Fundamental Energies are in a Challenging Transformation, with {Person2} controlling {Person1}. There is also potential for very good relationship chemistry and for a lot of growth.

<h5>
    Challenges
</h5>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} and {Person2} are in a Challenging Transformation, with {Person2} challenging or controlling {Person1}. This can increase the likelihood of conflict and misunderstandings. The challenging Energy ({Person2}) needs to take care not to become overly controlling.
</p>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} is a 1 Water Energy and is likely to be quite free-spirited and independent with a go-with-the-flow kind of attitude to life.

    {Person2Proper} is a Core Earth Energy. 5 Earths generally have a bold and possibly agressive or assertive nature. Waters are fairly flexible and so this may not be a problem in the early stages of a relationship. However, {Person2} could easily end up taking {Person1}'s easy-going nature for granted and even taking it to the point of becoming overly domineering. This could lead to resentment in the long term.
</p>
<p>
    5 Earths are typically not very receptive to "advice" from others, and so {Person2} may struggle to really fully benefit from {Person1}'s wisdom. This could be an source of disharmony in the relationship.
</p>
<p>
    Earth Energies tend to be structured and solid. However, too much rigidity can lead Water Energies to feel overly restricted and caged in.
</p>
<p>
    The risk of Water Energies ({Person1}) feeling restricted can also apply to the way in which they communicate. A common issue with this combination is that the Water Energy finds the Earth's thinking overly rational and lacking flexibilty and subtlety. They may find that their ideas are too frequently contradicted or dismissed and the Earth Energy may find it hard to fully relate to the deeper, more intuitive Water nature.
</p>

<h5>
    Strengths
</h5>
<p>
    Core Earth Energies, when out of balance, can be impractical and unorthodox. Water Energies have a deep sense of intuition and high emotional intelligence and can be of tremendous help to 5 Earths in this regard.
</p>
<p>
    5 Earth Energies often have a strong sense of direction and purpose and are grounded and reliable. This can especially helpful to Water Energies, who can sometimes lose their way and become a bit scattered or chaotic: they benefit immensely from having a container.
</p>
<p>
    Core Eartsh are supportive, grounded and helpful and this can be of great value to {Person1}, especially if {Gender1Pronoun} is ever feeling emotionally overwhelmed or under stress, which can lead to them becoming chaotic and ungrounded.
</p>

<h5>
    Final Thoughts
</h5>
<p>
    Generally speaking, this is a fairly challenging combination, but with great potential for growth and mutual support and learning. Water energies tend to be some of the most flexible and accomodating of the 9 Star Ki system, and so the risk of conflict is less than it might be in other antagonistic combinations.
