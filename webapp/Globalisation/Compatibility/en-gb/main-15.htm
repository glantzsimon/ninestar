    This is potentially quite a tricky combination, as the Fundamental Energies are in a Challenging Transformation, with {Person2} controlling {Person1}. There is also potential for very good relationships chemistry and for a lot of growth.

<p>
    {Person1Proper} is a 1 Water Energy and is likely to be quite free-spirited and independent with a go-with-the-flow kind of attitude to life. 
    
    {Person2Proper} is a Core Earth Energy. 5 Earths generally have a bold and possibly agressive or assertive nature. Waters are fairly flexible and so this may not be a problem in the early stages of a relationship. However, {Person2} could easily end up taking {Person1}'s easy-going nature for granted and even taking it to the point of becoming overly domineering. This could lead to resentment in the long term.
</p>
<p>
    {Person2Proper} can be impractical and unorthodox at times. Water Energies, with their deep sense of intuition and high emotional intelligence, can be of tremendous help to 5 Earths. Unfortunately, 5 Earths are typically not very receptive to "advice" from others, and so {Person2} may struggle to really fully benefit from {Person1}'s wisdom. This could be an additional source of disharmony in the relationship.
</p>
<p>
    5 Earth Energies often have a strong sense of direction and purpose and are grounded and reliable. This can especially helpful to Water Energies, who can sometimes lose their way and become a bit scattered or chaotic: they benefit immensely from having a container and Earth Energies are particularly good at providing this valuable trait. Nevertheless, too much structure can lead Water Energies to feel overly restricted and caged in. 
</p>
<p>
    The risk of Water Energies ({Person1}) feeling restricted can also apply to the way in which they communicate. A common issue with this combination is that the Water Energy finds the Earth's thinking overly rational and lacking flexibilty and subtlety. They may find that their ideas are too frequently contradicted or dismissed and the Earth Energy may find it hard to fully relate to the deeper, more intuitive Water nature.
</p>
<p>
    In a Challenging Transformation, the challenging Energy (in this case {Person2}) needs to take care not to become overly controlling. If an imbalance starts to appear, the challenged Energy (Person1) may grow resentful and pull away.
</p>
<p>
    Generally speaking, this is a fairly challenging combination, but with great potential for growth and mutual support and learning. Water energies tend to be some of the most flexible and accomodating of the 9 Star Ki system, and so the risk of conflict is less than it might be in other antagonistic combinations.

<p>
    The sexual chemistry between these two can be quie strong. Typically, the chemistry is stronger in antagonistic relationships. If couples with this combination persevere and work through their differences, it could easily lead to a deep, lifelong bond.
