<h5>
    This is potentially a very harmonious combination, as the Fundamental Energies are in a Supportive Transformation, with {Person2} supporting {Person1}. There is also potential for reasonable sexual chemistry and for quite a bit of growth. Conflict is less likely in this combination.

    {Person1Proper} is a 1 Water Energy and is likely to be quite free-spirited and independent with a go-with-the-flow kind of attitude to life.

    {Person2Proper} is a Heaven Energy. 6 Metals generally have a bold, moral and assertive nature. Waters are fairly flexible and easy-going and can likely cushion the sometimes overbearing quality of 6 Metals. However, {Person2} needs to be careful that they don't become overly domineering and take {Person1}'s easy-going nature for granted. This could lead to resentment in the long term.
</p>
<p>
    {Person2Proper} is probably quite pragmatic and rational in the way they operate. Sometimes this borders on the overly cautious. Water Energies, on the other hand, have a deep sense of intuition and, whilst they can be rational, they tend to draw more from their emotional intelligence. This gives {Person1} and {Person2} the potential to develop a very balanced and complementary relationship. However, it is important that {Person2} learns to be receptive to {Person1}'s wisdom. It is not a one-way street. Failure to do so could be an additional source of disharmony in the relationship.

<p>
    6 Metal Energies usually have a strong sense of direction and purpose and are quite grounded and reliable. This is especially helpful to Water Energies, who can sometimes lose their way and become a bit scattered or chaotic: they benefit immensely from the clarity and keen observational skills 6 Metals typically bring.

<p>
    Both {Person1} and {Person2} share the tendency to withdraw and be reserved. This could create distance and lack of communication and intimacy between them, at times. However, they are likely to understand one another if one person withdraws. Both have the potentially to be very loyal to their partners.
</p>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} and {Person2} are in a Supportive Transformation, which typically results in little conflict and a much deeper sense of harmony and mutual respect. Of all the Energies, Water is perhaps the most flexible and accomodating. 6 Metals can be overbearing at times, but Water energies have the strength and resilience of deep water and it rarely poses a problem for them.

    In a Supportive Transformation or Parent / Child relationship, the supported Energy (in this case {Person1}) needs to take care not to take the 'parent' for granted. If an imbalance starts to appear, the parent Energy may grow resentful and pull away.
