    This is potentially a very harmonious and exciting combination, as the Fundamental Energies are in a Supportive Transformation, with {Person2} supporting {Person1}. There is also potential for good sexual chemistry and for quite a bit of growth. Conflict is far less likely in this combination.

    {Person1Proper} is a 1 Water Energy and is likely to be quite free-spirited and independent with a go-with-the-flow kind of attitude to life.

    {Person2Proper} is a Lake Energy and is likely to be pretty laid-back and flexible also. Many Lakes feel very attracted to Water Energies and if they commit to them in relationship, they can be devoted and loyal partners.

    {Person2Proper} has qutie a pragmatic, rational and practical energy. 7 Energies are great at seeing the bigger picture, figuring out what needs to be done and how and gently conveying what they see, without being too overbearing. Water Energies are generally very receptive to the energy of Lakes and their practical, common sense guidance is immensely helpful to them.

    Equally, Water Energies have a deep sense of intuition and, whilst they can be rational, they tend to draw more from their emotional intelligence. This gives {Person1} and {Person2} the potential to develop a very balanced and complementary relationship. Typically in this combination both parties are able to remain reasonably open to one another's ideas and perspectives. It is not a one-way street. This can be one fo the most harmonious relationship combination in the 9 Star Ki system.

    7 Metal Energies, when inspired to, are very good at making plans and figuring out all the pracital details of how to accomplish whatever it is they are trying to do. Generally speaking, they are quite grounded and reliable. This is especially helpful to Water Energies, who can sometimes lose their way and become a bit scattered or chaotic: they benefit immensely from the clarity, rationality and keen observational skills Metals typically bring.

    {Person1Proper} and {Person2} are in a Supportive Transformation, which typically results in little conflict and a much deeper sense of harmony and mutual respect. Of all the Energies, Water is perhaps the most flexible and accomodating. Lakes can be a little sharp and overly critical from time to time, but Water energies have the strength and resilience of deep water and it rarely poses a problem for them.

    The sexual chemistry between these two is moderate to high. As the energetic gender of {Person1} is opposite to {Person2}, this creates additional chemistry and magnetism between these two people. Below we will look at the character numbers, as these are also important considerations when considering relationship compatibility.

    This has the potential to be a great relationship and could easily lead to a deep, lifelong commitment.
