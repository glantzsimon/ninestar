    This is potentially a very harmonious and exciting combination, as the Fundamental Energies are in a Supportive Transformation, with {Person2} supporting {Person1}. There is also potential for good sexual chemistry and for quite a bit of growth. Conflict is far less likely in this combination.

<h5>
    Strengths
</h5>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} and {Person2} are in a Supportive Transformation, with {Person2} supporting {Person1}. This type of combination typically leads to greater harmony and mutual understanding.
</p>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} is a 1 Water Energy and is likely to be quite free-spirited and independent with a go-with-the-flow kind of attitude to life.

    {Person2Proper} is a Lake Energy and is likely to be pretty laid-back and flexible. This makes for a very harmonious combination. 
</p>
<p>
    There is often a natural mutual attraction between Lakes and Water Energies, with plenty of chemistry.
</p>
<p>
    {Person2Proper} has quite a pragmatic, rational and practical energy. 7 Energies are great at seeing the bigger picture, figuring out what needs to be done and how, as well as gently conveying their ideas without being too overbearing (unlike 6 Metals). Water Energies are generally very receptive to the energy of Lakes and their practical, common sense guidance is immensely helpful to them.
</p>
<p>
    Equally, Water Energies have a deep sense of intuition and, whilst they can be rational, they tend to draw more from their emotional intelligence. This gives {Person1} and {Person2} the potential to develop a very balanced and complementary relationship. Typically in this combination both parties are able to remain reasonably open to one another's ideas and perspectives. It is not a one-way street. This can be one fo the most harmonious relationship combinations.
</p>
<p>
    7 Metal Energies, when inspired to, are very good at making plans and figuring out all the pracital details of how to accomplish whatever it is they are trying to do. Generally speaking, they are quite grounded and reliable. This is especially helpful to Water Energies, who can sometimes lose their way and become a bit scattered or chaotic: they benefit immensely from the clarity, rationality and keen observational skills Metals typically bring.
</p>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} and {Person2} are in a Supportive Transformation, which typically results in little conflict and a much deeper sense of harmony and mutual respect. Of all the Energies, Water is perhaps the most flexible and accomodating.
</p>

<h5>
    Challenges
</h5>
<p>
    Lakes can be a little sharp and overly critical from time to time and this could cause {Person1} to withdraw. However, Water Energies typically have the strength and resilience of deep water and the sharpness of the Metal element poses much less of a problem for them than it does for other Energies.
</p>
<p>
    In a Supportive Transformation or Parent / Child relationship, the supported Energy (in this case {Person1}) needs to take care not to take the 'parent' for granted. If an imbalance starts to appear, the parent Energy may grow resentful and pull away.
