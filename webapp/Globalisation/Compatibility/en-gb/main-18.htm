    This is potentially a very challenging combination indeed. The Fundamental Energies are in a Challenging Transformation, with {Person2} controlling {Person1}. Whilst there is potential for good chemistry and for quite a bit of growth, conflict and frustration are likely to be a big stumbling block in this combination.

<h5>
    Challenges
</h5>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} and {Person2} are in a Challenging Transformation, with {Person2} challenging or controlling {Person1}. This can increase the likelihood of conflict and misunderstandings. The challenging Energy ({Person2}) needs to take care not to become overly controlling.
</p>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} is a 1 Water Energy and is likely to be quite free-spirited and independent with a go-with-the-flow kind of attitude to life.

    {Person2Proper}, on the other hand, is a Mountain Energy. Mountains are perhaps the most rigid and possibly the least emotionally available of all the Energies. This can be extremely challenging for flexible, emotional and romantic Water Energies.
</p>
<p>
    {Person2Proper}, being a Mountain Energy, is likely to be pragmatic, rational and practical with a tendency towards being rather single-minded at times, even bordering on being a workaholic. Water Energies, whilst they are very independent, may find Mountain Energies a little too unavailable and could withdraw and eventually lose interest.
</p>
<p>
    Water Energies have a deep sense of intuition and, whilst they can be rational, they tend to draw more from their emotional intelligence. This is in stark contrast to {Person2}'s more detached, rational way of looking at the world. In this combination, there is a risk that the Water Energy ({Person1}) could find {Person2}'s way of thinking overly rational and lacking flexibilty and subtlety. {Person1Proper} may find that their ideas are too frequently contradicted or dismissed by {Person2} and, conversely, {Person2} may find it hard to fully relate to the deeper, more intuitive Water nature.
</p>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} and {Person2} are in a Challenging Transformation, which typically results in a fair amount of conflict. Mountain Energies are perhaps the most stubborn of all 9 Energies, whilst Waters are perhaps the most flexible and accomodating. Care must be taken that {Person2} doesn't take advantage of {Person1}'s kind nature, to the point that he or she feels taken for granted and unacknowledged.
</p>

<h5>
    Strengths
</h5>
<p>
    Mountain Energies, when inspired to, are very good at making plans and figuring out all the pracital details of how to accomplish whatever it is they are trying to do. Generally speaking, they are quite grounded, reliable and even single-minded when they have a goal they wish to achieve. This trait can be helpful to Water Energies, who can sometimes lose their way and become a bit scattered or chaotic: they benefit immensely from the clarity, rationality and stability that Mountains typically bring.
</p>
<p>
    Mountain Energies can be quite reserved and allof. However, If {Person1} can get {Person2} to open up and communicate more openly, then there is a potential for much growth and learning.
</p>
<p>
    Water Energies typically have great emotional intelligence and intuition. These qualities can be immensely helpful to Mountain Energies, who can be overly pragmatic and rational, helping to soften them and bring more balance.

<h5>
    Final Thoughts
</h5>
<p>
    {Person1} and {Person2} could, if they are committed to do so, develop a balanced and complementary relationship where each party draws on his or her strengths. This combination has the potential to be highly mutually beneficial. However, it is a very tricky combination to harmonise.
