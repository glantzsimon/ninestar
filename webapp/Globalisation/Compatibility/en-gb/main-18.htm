    This is potentially a very challenging combination indeed. The Fundamental Energies are in a Challenging Transformation, with {Person2} controlling {Person1}. Whilst there is potential for good sexual chemistry and for quite a bit of growth, conflict and frustration are likely to be a big stumbling block in this combination.

<p>
    {Person1Proper} is a 1 Water Energy and is likely to be quite free-spirited and independent with a go-with-the-flow kind of attitude to life.

    {Person2Proper}, on the other hand, is possibly as far away as you could get to Water Energy. Mountain energies are perhaps the most rigid and possibly the least emotionally available of all the Energies. This can be extremely challenging for flexible, emotional and romantic Water Energies.
</p>
<p>
    {Person2Proper} is pragmatic, rational and practical. They can be single-minded at times and tend towards becoming workaholics. Water Energies, whilst they are very independent, may find Mountain Energies a little too unavailable and could withdraw and eventually lose interest. 
</p>
<p>
    If {Person1} can get {Person2} to open up and communicate more openly, then there is a potential for much growth and learning.
</p>
<p>
    Water Energies have a deep sense of intuition and, whilst they can be rational, they tend to draw more from their emotional intelligence. This is in stark contrast to {Person2}'s more detached, rational way of looking at the world. In this combination, there is a risk that the Water Energy ({Person1}) could find {Person2}'s way of thinking overly rational and lacking flexibilty and subtlety. {Person1Proper} may find that their ideas are too frequently contradicted or dismissed by {Person2} and, conversely, {Person2} may find it hard to fully relate to the deeper, more intuitive Water nature.
</p>    
<p>
    {Person1} and {Person2} could, if they are committed to do so, develop a balanced and complementary relationship where each party draws on his or her strengths. This combination has the potential to be highly mutually beneficial. However, it is a very tricky combination to harmonise.
</p>
<p>
    Mountain Energies, when inspired to, are very good at making plans and figuring out all the pracital details of how to accomplish whatever it is they are trying to do. Generally speaking, they are quite grounded, reliablea and even single-minded when they have a goal they wish to achieve. This trait can be helpful to Water Energies, who can sometimes lose their way and become a bit scattered or chaotic: they benefit immensely from the clarity, rationality and stability that Mountains typically bring.
</p>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} and {Person2} are in a Challenging Transformation, which typically results in a fair amount of conflict. Mountain Energies are perhaps the most stubborn of all 9 Energies, whilst Waters are perhaps the most flexible and accomodating. Care must be taken that {Person2} doesn't take advantage of {Person1}'s kind nature, to the point that he or she feels taken for granted and unacknowledged.
</p>
<p>
    The sexual chemistry between these two has the potential to be high. The energetic gender of {Person1} and {Person2} is the same, but because the personalities of these two Energies are so different, and as the element is in a Challenging Transformation, it tends to result in strong sexual chemistry. Below we will look at the character numbers, as these are also important considerations when considering relationship compatibility.
</p>
<p>
    This has the potential to be a good relationship, but it would require a fair amount of commitment to make it work. If both partners put the effort in and stick around, there is no reason why this combination couldn't lead to a deep, lifelong commitment.
