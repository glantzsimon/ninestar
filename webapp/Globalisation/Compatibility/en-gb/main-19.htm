<h5>
    This is potentially a very challenging combination. The Fundamental Energies are in a Challenging Transformation, with {Person1} controlling {Person2}. Whilst there is potential for good sexual chemistry and for quite a bit of growth, conflict and frustration are likely to be a big stumbling block in this combination.

<p>
    {Person1Proper} is a 1 Water Energy and is likely to be quite free-spirited and independent with a go-with-the-flow kind of attitude to life.

    {Person2Proper} is also pretty free-spirited and spontaneous, however Fire Energies are possibly more attached to getting their own way than Water Energies. Initially, this is unlikely to be a problem, as Water's easy-going, go-with-the-flow nature can easily accomodate stronger chracters. However, over time, there is a risk of this causing an imbalance in the relationship, leading to resentment and conflict.
</p>
<p>
    Fire Energies can be pretty liberal and enlightened. However, when out of balance, they can be quite vein, self-centred and overly critical. These tendencies, when expressed, are likely to trigger {Person1}, who may feel compelled to deliver some of their "Water" wisdom, which is typically deep and well thought or "felt" out. Water and Fire are poles apart and the intelligence that Water brings can sometimes be too subtle and therefore confusing for the energy of Fire, which is more adept at observing that which is illuminated and fully manifest. Too much Water element can, unsurprisingly, cause the Fire to start to go out.
</p>
<p>
    Fires, when out of balance, can be rather impulsive, changeable and even erratic. Water Energies, being very flexible and accomodating, can usually handle this fairly well. Indeed, their gentle, soothing and empathetic nature and be of great assistance in calming the Fire Energy down.
</p>
<p>
    {Person1Proper}, when out of balance, is likely to become undisciplined and rather chaotic. This is where {Person2} can be of great assistance, as Fires are full of bright ideas and clarity and can be such highly inspirational people. Therefore {Person2} could really help to bring clarity and direction to {Person1}.
</p>
<p>
    {Person2Proper} may find {Person1}'s fiercely independent nature a challenge at times. Fires typically need quite a bit of support and don't like to be alone for too long, and whilst Waters are often very nurturing, they do like their own space. This is another potential source of conflict in the relationship.
</p>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} and {Person2} are in a Challenging Transformation, which typically results in a fair amount of conflict and misunderstanding. However, thanks to Water's flexible and empathetic nature, this is less of an issue than it might be in other combinations.
