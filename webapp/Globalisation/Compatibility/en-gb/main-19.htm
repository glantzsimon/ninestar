Whilst there is potential for good chemistry and for quite a bit of growth, conflict and frustration are likely to be a big stumbling block in this combination.

<h5>
    Challenges
</h5>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} and {Person2} are in a Challenging Transformation, with {Person1} challenging or controlling {Person2}. This can increase the likelihood of conflict and misunderstandings. The challenging Energy ({Person1}) needs to take care not to dominate in the relationship.
</p>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} is a 1 Water Energy and is likely to be quite free-spirited and independent with a go-with-the-flow kind of attitude to life.

    {Person2Proper} is a Fire Energy. Fires also tend to be pretty free-spirited and spontaneous; however, they are possibly more attached to getting their own way than Water energies. Initially, this is unlikely to be a problem, as Water's easy-going, go-with-the-flow nature can easily accomodate stronger chracters. However, over time, there is a risk of this causing an imbalance in the relationship, leading to resentment and conflict.
</p>
<p>
    Fire energies can be pretty liberal and enlightened. However, when out of balance, they can be quite vain, self-centred and overly critical. These tendencies, when expressed, are likely to trigger {Person1}, who may feel compelled to deliver some of their "Water" wisdom, which is typically deep and well thought or "felt" out. Water and Fire are poles apart and the intelligence that Water brings can sometimes be too subtle and therefore confusing for the energy of Fire, which is more adept at observing that which is illuminated and fully manifest. Too much Water element can, unsurprisingly, cause the Fire to start to go out.
</p>
<p>
    {Person2Proper} may find {Person1}'s fiercely independent nature a challenge at times. Fires typically need quite a bit of support and don't like to be alone for too long, and whilst Waters are often very nurturing, they do like their own space. This is another potential source of conflict in the relationship.
</p>

<h5>
    Strengths
</h5>
<p>
    Fires, when out of balance, can be rather impulsive, changeable and even erratic. Water energies, being very flexible and accommodating, can usually handle this fairly well. Indeed, their gentle, soothing and empathetic nature and be of great assistance in calming the Fire Energy down.
</p>
<p>
    {Person1Proper}, when out of balance, is likely to become undisciplined and rather chaotic. This is where {Person2} can be of great assistance, as Fires are full of bright ideas and clarity and can be such highly inspirational people. Therefore {Person2} could really help to bring clarity and direction to {Person1}.
</p>
<p>
    Fire and Water represent the extremes of light and dark: high summer and deep winter or the midday sun and midnight. Each benefits from great wisdom and insights related to their element. Despite the polarity between them, there is incredible potential for learning and personal growth if both parties can be open to the other's wisdom, helping to create a more complete picture with the illumination of Fire and the deep intuitive understanding of Water.
</p>

<h5>
    Final Thoughts
</h5>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} and {Person2} are in a Challenging Transformation, which typically results in a fair amount of conflict and misunderstanding. However, thanks to Water's flexible and empathetic nature, this is less of an issue than it might be in other combinations.
