    This is potentially a very challenging combination. The Fundamental Energies are in a Challenging Transformation, with {Person1} controlling {Person2}. Whilst there is potential for good sexual chemistry and for quite a bit of growth, conflict and frustration are likely to be a big stumbling block in this combination.

<p>
    {Person1Proper} is a 1 Water Energy and is likely to be quite free-spirited and independent with a go-with-the-flow kind of attitude to life.

    {Person2Proper} is also pretty free-spirited and spontaneous, however Fire Energies are possibly more attached to getting their own way than Water Energies. Initially, this is unlikely to be a problem, as Water's easy-going, go-with-the-flow nature can easily accomodate the more impulsive, changeable qualities of Fire Energy.
</p>
<p>
    Fire Energies can be pretty liberal and enlightened. However, they can equally be quite vein, self-centred and overly critical. These qualities are likely to trigger {Person1} into delivering some wisdom and emotional intelligence from the depths of the Water element, which can sometimes be confusing and too "deep" for the energy of Fire, which is more about that which is directly illuminated, to grasp. This can cause the Fire to start to go out, which is not surprising, as we all know that Water puts out Fire. In other words, Fire Energies can easily get lost in the watery world of deep emotions, instincts, intuition and gut feelings.
</p>
<p>
    Water Energies, whilst they are very independent, may find Fires little too unavailable and could withdraw and eventually lose interest.
</p>
<p>
    If {Person1} can get {Person2} to open up and communicate more openly, then there is a potential for much growth and learning.
</p>
<p>
    Water Energies have a deep sense of intuition and, whilst they can be rational, they tend to draw more from their emotional intelligence. This is in stark contrast to {Person2}'s more detached, rational way of looking at the world. {Person1} and {Person2} could, if they are committed to do so, develop a balanced and complementary relationship where each party draws on his or her strengths. This combination has the potential to be highly mutually beneficial. However, it is a very tricky combination to harmonise.

    Mountain Energies, when inspired to, are very good at making plans and figuring out all the pracital details of how to accomplish whatever it is they are trying to do. Generally speaking, they are quite grounded, reliablea and even single-minded when they have a goal they wish to achieve. This trait can be helpful to Water Energies, who can sometimes lose their way and become a bit scattered or chaotic: they benefit immensely from the clarity, rationality and stability that Mountains typically bring.
</p>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} and {Person2} are in a Challenging Transformation, which typically results in a fair amount of conflict. Mountain Energies are perhaps the most stubborn of all 9 Energies, whilst Waters are perhaps the most flexible and accomodating. Care must be taken that {Person2} doesn't take advantage of {Person1}'s kind nature, to the point that he or she feels taken for granted and unacknowledged.
</p>
<p>
    The sexual chemistry between these two is high. The energetic gender of {Person1} and {Person2} is the same, but because the personalities of these two Energies are so different, and as the element is in a Challenging Transformation, it tends to result in strong sexual chemistry. Below we will look at the character numbers, as these are also important considerations when considering relationship compatibility.
</p>
<p>
    This has the potential to be a good relationship, but it would require a fair amount of commitment to make it work. If both partners put the effort in and stick around, there is no reason why this combination couldn't lead to a deep, lifelong commitment.
