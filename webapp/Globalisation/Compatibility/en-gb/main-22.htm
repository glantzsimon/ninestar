    This has the potential to be a very harmonious combination. However, it might be better suited to friendship than romance.
</h5>

<h5>
    Strengths
</h5>
<p>
    Both people share the same Solar Energy "Soil". Both people are stable, reliable, supportive types who are likely to have very similar values and priorities. This could very well result in a close friendship where both people feel understood, supported and that they can rely on one another.
</p>
<p>
    There is a great potential for collaboration on various projects within the community, or at home and there are probably lots of shared interests, such as gardening, Nature walks, cooking and other grounding, practical activities.
</p>

<h5>
    Challenges
</h5>
<p>
    Soil energies have a tendency to get bogged down with detail and be overly fastidious. This combination could exacerbate such tendencies.
</p>
<p>
    With both people in this combination being entirely Yin, the absence of Yang could result in their losing direction and rather than being able to help one another figure out a plan, their shared vulnerability could potential aggravate the problem.
</p>
<p>
    As both energies share the same Solar Energy, there are generally many more similarities between them, which can lead to decreased magnetism and potential for challenge and growth.
