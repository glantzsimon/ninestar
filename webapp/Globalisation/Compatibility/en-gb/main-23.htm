    This is potentially quite a challenging combination, as the Fundamental Energies are in a Challenging Transformation, with {Person2} overriding or controlling {Person1}. However, there is a potential for good relationships chemistry and for growth.
</h5>
<p>
    {Person2Proper} is a 3 Tree Energy and is likely to be very energetic, changeable and even impulsive and explosive at times. {Person1Proper}, on the other hand, is a Soil Energy and is more likely to be structured and disciplined. This could be perceieved as overly rigid and cautious by {Person2} and could be source of much frustration.
</p>
<p>
    What can often happen in this combination is that the Thunder Energy ({Person2}) can get frustrated withe {Person1}'s slow, cautious pace and feel compelled to push or pressure them in various ways. That might take the form of {Person2} giving {Person1} constant advice and possibly really insisting (which tends to caue Soils to dig their heals in), or {Person2} might simply try to persuade {Peson1} to go along with some plan or project that (s)he is excited about. Soil Energies are notoriously resistant to receiving advice, especially when given in an overly forceful of enthusiastic manner. They require time to think things through. This can be a huge source of conflict and frustration for both parties.
</p>
<p>
    Another issue that often arises in this combination is that the steadier, more reliable Soil Energy ({Person1})
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand, {Person2}'s steady, pragmatic nature could equally be very beneficial to {Person1}, providing structure. Water, without a container, can become chaotic and undisciplined.
</p>
<p>
    Conversely, {Person1} can help {Person2} to loosen up and be less rigid; to flow more, like Water. This can be immensely helpful to Earth Energies, who sometimes need to be reminded to let their hair down and have more fun.
</p>
<p>
    Both Energies can express a sensitive, diplomatic side and this favours healthy communication between them.
</p>
<p>
    However, {Person1}'s need for independence and lots of space could trigger {Person2}'s tendency towards codependency and neediness, creating possible relationship tension. Nevertheless, Water is naturally empathetic and receptive and so any relationship conflict is likely to be resolved fairly easily.
</p>
<p>
    There is a higher than average risk of conflict and misunderstanding, owing to the challenging nature of this combination. However, Water energies tend to be some of the most flexible and accomodating of the 9 Star Ki system, and so this is less of an issue than it might be in other antagonistic combinations.
</p>
<p>
    The sexual chemistry between these two could very well be quite strong, given the antagonistic nature of the relationship, plus the fact that {Person1}'s energetic 'gender' is opposite {Person2}. However, due to the higher risk of conflict in this kind of combination, it may be challenging to establish a healthy, long-term romantic relationship. If couples do succeed in making this type of combination work, it often ends up being an incredibly strong, lifelong bond.
