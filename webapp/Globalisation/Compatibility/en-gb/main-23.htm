<h5>
    This is potentially quite a challenging combination, as the Fundamental Energies are in a Challenging Transformation, with {Person2} overriding or controlling {Person1}. However, there is a potential for good relationships chemistry and for personal growth.
</h5>
<p>
    {Person2Proper} is a 3 Tree Energy and is likely to be very energetic, changeable and even impulsive and explosive at times. {Person1Proper}, on the other hand, is a Soil Energy and is more likely to be structured and disciplined. This could be perceieved as overly rigid and cautious by {Person2} and could be source of much frustration.
</p>
<p>
    What can often happen in this combination is that the Thunder Energy ({Person2}) can get frustrated with {Person1}'s slow, cautious pace and feel compelled to push or pressure them in various ways. That might take the form of {Person2} giving {Person1} constant advice and possibly really insisting (which tends to cause Soils to dig their heals in), or {Person2} might simply try to persuade {Person1} to go along with some plan or project that (s)he is excited about. Soil Energies are notoriously resistant to receiving advice, especially when given in an overly forceful or enthusiastic manner, or if too much information is expressed all at once. They require time to think things through. This can be a huge source of conflict and frustration for both parties.
</p>
<p>
    Another issue that often arises in this combination is that the steadier, more reliable Soil Energy ({Person1}) can find the unpredictable, changeable nature of Thunder quite disruptive and stressful. In order for this not to become a serious issue in the relationship, both parties would need to work together to find a common ground and, as always, communication is the key.
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand, {Person1}'s steady, pragmatic nature could be very beneficial to {Person2}, providing structure and grounding. Thunder Energies are known to get a bit carried away and an benefit hugely from having their visions grounded. Tree Energies also require a lot of practical support, especially on an everyday basis, as they are often moving about all over the place. The quiet, steady, nurturing nature of Soils can be immensely supportive to Tree Energies.
</p>
<p>
    Conversely, {Person2} can help {Person1} to loosen up and be less rigid. When done with patience and tact, this can be immensely helpful to Earth Energies, who sometimes need to be reminded to let their hair down.
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand, {Person2} may sometimes find that their ideas and visions are not fully understood or appreciated by {Person1}, whose cautious nature may lead them to be dismissive. This can be very discouraging to Tree Energies and, over time, could be a significant source of pain and resentment.
</p>
<p>
    Whilst Soil Energies are often quite sensitive and diplomatic in the way they communicate, Thunders are rather more blunt and can be a little insensitive at times. There is a chance that {Person2} could frequently hurt {Person1}'s feelings through their lack of tact. This is an area that will likely need to be addressed in the relationship.
