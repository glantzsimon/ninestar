    This is potentially quite a challenging combination, as the Fundamental Energies are in a Challenging Transformation, with {Person2} overriding or controlling {Person1}. However, there is a potential for good relationship chemistry and for personal growth.

<h5>
    Challenges
</h5>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} and {Person2} are in a Challenging Transformation, with {Person2} challenging or controlling {Person1}. This can increase the likelihood of conflict and misunderstandings. The challenging Energy ({Person2}) needs to take care not to dominate in the relationship.
</p>
<p>
    {Person2Proper} is a 4 Tree Energy and is likely to be very energetic, changeable and even impulsive at times. {Person1Proper}, on the other hand, is a Soil Energy and is more likely to be structured and disciplined. This could be perceieved as overly rigid and cautious by {Person2} and could be source of frustration in the relationship.
</p>
<p>
    What can often happen in this combination is that the Wind Energy ({Person2}) can feel frustrated with {Person1}'s slow, cautious pace and feel compelled to try to persuade them. Winds are known to be incredibly persuasive; however, it doesn't always work with Earth Energies and can cause them to dig their heals in. Soil Energies, in particular, are notoriously resistant to receiving advice, especially when given in an overly enthusiastic manner or if too much information is given all at once (which is another trait of Wind Energies). They require time to think things through. This can be a huge source of conflict and frustration for both parties.
</p>
<p>
    Another issue that often arises in this combination is that the steadier Soil Energy ({Person1}) can find the unpredictable, changeable nature of Wind to be a little disruptive or stressful. However, this is less of an issue than with 3 Tree Energies.
</p>
<p>
    {Person2Proper} may sometimes find that their ideas and visions are not fully understood or appreciated by {Person1}, whose cautious nature may lead them to be dismissive. This can be very discouraging to Tree Energies and, overtime, could be a significant source of pain and resentment.
</p>
<p>
    Both Energies are Yin, which can sometimes lead to stagnation in romantic relationships.
</p>

<h5>
    Strengths
</h5>
<p>
    {Person1Proper}'s steady, pragmatic nature could be very beneficial to {Person2}, providing structure and grounding. Wind Energies can get a bit carried away and an benefit hugely from having their visions grounded.
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand, unlike 3 Tree Energies, 4 Trees are often very thoughtful, reliable and practical. As both {Person1} and {Person2} share these qualities, there is a good chance that they can work very well together on various projects and activities, supporting and encouraging each other in quite a balanced way.
</p>
<p>
    {Person2Proper} can help {Person1} to loosen up and be less rigid. When done with patience and tact, this can be immensely helpful to Earth Energies, who sometimes need to be reminded to let their hair down.
</p>
<p>
    Both Soil and Wind Energies tend to be quite sensitive and diplomatic in the way they communicate and therefore, despite their energetic differences, conflict resolution tends to come more easily to this pair than with 3 Tree / Soil combinations.
