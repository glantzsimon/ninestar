    This has the potential to be a very harmonious combination. However, it might be better suited to friendship than romance.
</h5>

<h5>
    Strengths
</h5>
<p>
    Both people share the same Fundamental Element "Earth". Both people are stable, reliable, supportive types who are likely to have very similar values and priorities. This could very well result in a close friendship where both people feel understood, supported and that they can rely on one another.
</p>
<p>
    5 Earth people typially like to be at the centre of everything they do and are very group-oriented, where they like to take the lead. Soil Energies are also very happy working as part of a group or team and so it's highly likely that {Person1} would offer endless support to {Person2}.
</p>
<p>
    There is a great potential for collaboration on various projects within the community, or at home and there are probably lots of shared interests, such as gardening, Nature walks, cooking and other grounding, practical activities.
</p>
<p>
    5 Core Earth Energies are good at taking the lead and figuring out a plan. This is complimentary to {Person1}, who, being a Soil Energy and entirely Yin, is at risk of losing direction without the guidance of Yang energy.
</p>

<h5>
    Challenges
</h5>
<p>
    Soil Energies have a tendency to get bogged down with detail and be overly fastidious, which could be a potential source of irritation for {Person2}, who may feel some impatience in moving things forward. However, it's unlikely to be a major source of conflict.
</p>
<p>
    As both Energies are Earth element, there are many more similarities than differences, resulting in relatively fewer opportunities for challenge and growth. This can potentially lead to stagnation or boredom in the relationship over time.
