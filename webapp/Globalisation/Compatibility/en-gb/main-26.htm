    This is potentially a very harmonious and complementary combination. Soil and Heaven Energies represent the "Mother" and "Father" archetype, with the former being all Yin and the latter all Yang. This is a very strong combination.

<h5>
    Strengths
</h5>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} and {Person2} are in a Supportive Transformation, with {Person1} supporting {Person2}. This type of combination typically leads to greater harmony and mutual understanding.
</p>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} is a Soil  Energy and is most likely stable, reliable and supportive.

    {Person2Proper} is a Heaven Energy. 6 Metals generally have a bold, moral and assertive nature and like to take the lead. This typically poses no problem for 2 Soil Energies, who are happy to follow and take a supportive role.
</p>
<p>
    Both 6 Metal Energies and Soils are quite grounded and reliable. In addition, 6 Metals usually have a strong sense of direction and purpose, which is something that 2 Soils can lack, at times. These two Energies make a great team, both in relationships and at work.
</p>
<p>
    Both have the potentially to be very loyal to their partners.
</p>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} and {Person2} are in a Supportive Transformation, which typically results in little conflict and a much deeper sense of harmony and mutual respect. 6 Metals can be overbearing at times, but Soils typically have the patience and resilience to tolerate this tendency and it rarely leads to conflict in this combination.
</p>

<h5>
    Challenges
</h5>
<p>
    {Person2} needs to be careful that they don't become overly domineering and take {Person1}'s gentle, supportive nature for granted. This could lead to resentment in the long term.
</p>
<p>
    {Person2Proper} is quite pragmatic and rational in the way {Gender2Pronoun} operates. Sometimes this borders on the overly cautious. {Person2} shares this trait with {Person1} and therefore there could be a risk of these tendencies being exacerbated, leading to further imbalance.
</p>
<p>
    Both {Person1} and {Person2} share the tendency to withdraw and be reserved at times.  This could create distance and lack of communication and intimacy between them, at times. However, they are likely to understand one another if one person withdraws.
</p>
<p>
    In a Supportive Transformation or Parent / Child relationship, the supported Energy (in this case {Person2}) needs to take care not to take the 'parent' for granted. If an imbalance starts to appear, the parent Energy may grow resentful and pull away.
