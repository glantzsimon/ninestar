    This is potentially a very harmonious and complementary combination with less likelihood of conflict and misunderstanding.

    Strengths
</h5>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} and {Person2} are in a Supportive Transformation, with {Person1} supporting {Person2}. This type of combination typically leads to greater harmony and mutual understanding.
</p>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} is a Soil  Energy and is most likely stable, reliable and supportive.

    {Person2Proper} is a Lake Energy. Lakes generally have a laid-back nature and are supportive, pragmatic and reliable. This is generally an excellent combination with Soil's steady, reliable and supportive nature. This couple can work very well together on various projects at home or at work and will easily develop a deep sense of trust for each other.
</p>
<p>
    Both {Person2Proper} and {Person1} are quite rational and systematic in the way they operate. However, Soil Energies can be a little too detail-oriented and fastidious at times and can greatly benefit from the immense common sense that Lakes tend to have. Lake Energies also possess the tact and diplomacy to give guidance to Soil Energies without making them feel overly critised or pushed.
</p>
<p>
    7 Metals are typically quite good at planning ahead and prioritising tasks logically, which can be immensely helpful to 2 Soils, who can at times get bogged down in detail and lose direction.
</p>
<p>
    This combination is a Supportive Transformation, which typically results in little conflict and a much deeper sense of harmony and mutual respect.
</p>

<h5>
    Challenges
</h5>
<p>
    Both {Person1} and {Person2} share the tendency to withdraw and be reserved at times. {Person2} can also be aloof and emotionally distant when out of balance.  This could create distance and lack of communication and intimacy between them, at times. In addition, both Energies are Yin, which could further exacerbate this issue and lead to relationship stagnation.
</p>
<p>
    Lake and Soil Energies are both pretty rational in their thinking. The absence of more intuitive, emotional energy, which one finds with Fire, Water and Tree Energies, for example, could potentially lead to an imbalance and a tendency towards over rationality, skepticism and narrow-mindedness.
</p>
<p>
    In a Supportive Transformation or Parent / Child relationship, the supported Energy (in this case {Person2}) needs to take care not to take the 'parent' for granted. If an imbalance starts to appear, the parent Energy may grow resentful and pull away.
