    This has the potential to be a very harmonious combination. However, it might be better suited to friendship than romance.
</h5>

<h5>
    Strengths
</h5>
<p>
    Both people share the same Fundamental Element "Earth". Both people are stable, reliable, supportive types who are likely to have very similar values and priorities. This could very well result in a close friendship where both people feel understood, supported and that they can rely on one another.
</p>
<p>
    There is a great potential for collaboration on various projects within the community, or at home and there are probably lots of shared interests, such as gardening, Nature walks, cooking and other grounding, practical activities.
</p>
<p>
    2 Soils are typically much more community and group-oriented than Mountains, who can be quite solitary and withdrawn at times. {Person1Proper}'s more socially spirited nature could help to bring {Person2} out of {Gender2PossessivePronoun} "cave"
</p>
<p>
    {Person2} is Yang, which is complimentary to {Person1}, who is entirely Yin and can lose direction, at times, without the guidance of Yang energy.
</p>

<h5>
    Challenges
</h5>
<p>
    {Person2Proper}, when out of balance, could have a tendency to become very withdrawn and uncommunicative. This could be a source of pain for {Person1}, who, being a Soil Energy, is likely to need more connection and presence from a partner.
</p>
<p>
    Both Soil and Mountain Energies share the tendency to get bogged down with detail and be overly fastidious. This shared trait could be exacerbated in this combination.
