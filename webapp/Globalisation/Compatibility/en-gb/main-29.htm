<h5>
    This is potentially a very harmonious combination, as the Fundamental Energies are in a Supportive Transformation, with {Person2} supporting {Person1}. There is also potential for good sexual chemistry and for personal growth. Conflict is less likely in this combination.

    {Person1Proper} is a Soil Energy. Soil Energies are typically stable, reliable, supportive and practical.

    {Person2Proper} is a Fire Energy. Fires, on the other hand, are quite free-spirited and spontaneous. This can either be a welcomed trait, bringing variety and energy to the relationship, or, conversely, it could result in frustration, as sometimes Soil Energies can be stubborn and resistant to change not instigated by them and Fires can be impulsive and unpredictable. Nevertheless, as these Energies are in a Supportive Transformation, it is more likely to be a harmonious connection.
</p>
<p>
    It's possible {Person1} could have the tendency to withdraw and be rather reserved from time to time. On the other hand, {Person2}, being a Fire Energy, likely needs to feel appreciated and could struggle with {Person1}'s more reserved side. This could potentially create some distance and conflict in the relationship. Nevertheless, Fires are excellent communicators and this increases the chances of resolving any such issues, should they arise.

    Both Energies also have the potentially to be very loyal to their partners.
</p>
<p>
    Fire Energies can be pretty liberal and enlightened. However, when out of balance, they can be vein, self-centred and overly critical. Soil Energies are fairly tolerant and forgiving, but {Person2} should take care not to be overly critical, as Soil Energies can be quite sensitive to criticism.
</p>
<p>
    {Person1Proper}, when out of balance, could become quite bogged down with detail and lose direction. This is where {Person2} can be of great assistance, as Fires are full of bright ideas and clarity and can be such highly inspirational people. Therefore {Person2} could really help to bring clarity and direction to {Person1}.
</p>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} and {Person2} are in a Supportive Transformation, which typically results in little conflict and a much deeper sense of harmony, and mutual respect and understanding.
</p>
<p>
    In a Supportive Transformation or Parent / Child relationship, the supported Energy (in this case {Person1}) needs to take care not to take the 'parent' for granted. If an imbalance starts to appear, the parent Energy may grow resentful and pull away.
