    This is a fairly harmonious combination with a great potential for friendship and mutual understanding.

    Strengths
</h5>
<p>
    Both people share the same Fundamental Energy "Thunder". Thunder Energies typically really enjoy talking to and spending time with other Thunder Energies. One of the reasons for this is that they often find that other Thunders are the only people who can truly keep up! As the other Energies in the 9 Star Ki system sometimes find Thunder Energies a bit overwhelming, this can be a great relief and often results in deep and meaningful friendship.
</p>
<p>
    Both people are typically full of energy and spontaneity and are likely to engage in a lots of different activities together. They are also likely to talk until the cows come home.

<h5>
    Challenges
</h5>
<p>
    Both Energies are highly energetic and there is an increased risk of wearing one another out. This may mean that they find it harder to spend long periods of time together without it leading to exhaustion.
</p>
<p>
    Thunder Energies can be unpredictable and even explosive at times and there is a chance that this could lead to occasional rows. If one person gets worked up, then this could easily lead to both parties losing their cool and saying things they later regret. However, Thunder Energies are typically quick to forgive and their sensitivity and adaptable nature help them to resolve conflict fairly quickly.
</p>
<p>
    Both Energies have a tendency to develop grandiose and unrealistic ideas from time to time and therefore, with this combination, there is an even greater risk of both parties getting carried away and becoming rather ungrounded. It is usually a good idea to run things past other Energies and elements before embarking on a new project.
</p>
<p>
    As both Energies share the same Fundamental Energy, there are generally many more similarities between them, which can lead to decreased magnetism and potential for challenge and growth.
