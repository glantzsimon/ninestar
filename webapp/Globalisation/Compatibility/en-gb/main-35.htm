<h5>
    This is potentially quite a challenging combination, as the Fundamental Energies are in a Challenging Transformation, with {Person1} overriding or controlling {Person2}. However, there is a potential for good relationships chemistry and for growth.
</h5>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} is a 3 Tree Energy and is likely to be very energetic, changeable and even impulsive and explosive at times. {Person2Proper}, on the other hand, is a Core Earth Energy and is more likely to be steady, pragmatic and single-minded. This could be perceieved as overly rigid and stubborn by {Person1} and could be source of much frustration.
</p>
<p>
    What can often happen in this combination is that the Thunder Energy ({Person1}) can get frustrated with {Person2}'s perceived "stubborness" and feel compelled to push or pressure them in various ways. That might take the form of {Person1} giving {Person2} constant advice and possibly really insisting (which tends to cause 5 Earths to really dig their heals in), or {Person1} might simply try to persuade {Person2} to go along with some plan or project that (s)he is excited about. 5 Earth Energies are notoriously resistant to receiving advice, especially when given in an overly forceful or enthusiastic manner, or if too much information is expressed all at once. They require time to think things through. This can be a huge source of conflict and frustration for both parties.
</p>
<p>
    Another issue that often arises in this combination is that the steadier, more reliable Earth Energy ({Person2}) can find the unpredictable, changeable nature of Thunder quite disruptive and stressful. In order for this not to become a serious issue in the relationship, both parties would need to work together to find a common ground and, as always, communication is the key.
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand, {Person2}'s steady, pragmatic nature could be very beneficial to {Person1}, providing structure and grounding. Thunder Energies are known to get a bit carried away and an benefit hugely from having their visions grounded. Tree Energies also require a lot of practical support, especially on an everyday basis, as they are often moving about all over the place. The solid, steady, nurturing nature of 5 Earths can be immensely supportive to Tree Energies.
</p>
<p>
    Conversely, {Person1} can help {Person2} to loosen up and be less rigid. When done with patience and tact, this can be immensely helpful to Earth Energies, who sometimes need to be reminded to loosen up and let their hair down.
</p>
<p>
    5 Earth Energies can get quite obsessed with their work or projects they're involved in. This can sometimes lead to them spending a lot of time away from home. Tree Energies, whilst they are quite independent, also love company and conversation and may grow tired and frustrated if their partner spends too much time away.
</p>
<p>
    Both 5 Earth and Thunder Energies can be quite bold in the way they communicate. This could potentially lead to conflict. Thunders can also be quite blunt and insensitive at times in the way they express themselves verbally. There is a chance that {Person1} could frequently hurt {Person2}'s feelings through their lack of tact. This is an area that will likely need to be addressed in the relationship.
