    This is potentially quite a challenging combination, as the Fundamental Energies are in a Challenging Transformation, with {Person2} overriding or controlling {Person1}. However, there is a potential for good relationships chemistry and for personal growth.
</h5>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} is a 3 Tree Energy and is likely to be very energetic, changeable and even impulsive and explosive at times. {Person2Proper}, on the other hand, is a Heaven Energy and is more reserved, pragmatic and single-minded. This could be perceieved as overly rigid and cautious by {Person1} and could be source of much frustration.
</p>
<p>
    What can often happen in this combination is that the Thunder Energy ({Person1}) can feel overly controlled and criticised by {Person2}. Metal Energies tend to be very rational thinkers and often feel compelled to contradict and possibly pick apart many of the ideas expressed by Tree Energies. Metal's feedback can be very valuable to Tree Energies, as it can help to refine their ideas and visions; however, care must be taken not to be overly harsh and relentless in the way they express their opinions, as this can result in Tree people losing confidence in themselves. The image of an overly pruned Tree comes to mind.
</p>
<p>
    Another issue that often arises in this combination is that the steadier, more reliable Metal Energy ({Person2}) can find the unpredictable, changeable nature of Thunder quite disruptive and stressful. In order for this not to become a serious issue in the relationship, both parties would need to work together to find a common ground and, as always, communication is the key.
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand, {Person2}'s steady, pragmatic nature could be very beneficial to {Person1}, providing structure and grounding. Thunder Energies are known to get a bit carried away and an benefit hugely from having their visions grounded. Tree Energies also require a lot of practical support, especially on an everyday basis, as they are often moving about all over the place. The solid, steady, pracitcal nature of 6 Metal Energies can be immensely supportive to Tree Energies.
</p>
<p>
    Conversely, {Person1} can help {Person2} to loosen up and be less rigid. When done tact and sensitiviy, this can be immensely helpful to Heaven Energies, who sometimes need to be reminded to let their hair down.
</p>
<p>
    An area of great potential frustration in this combination can be conflict resolution, especially when there are strong emotions. Heaven and Thunder Energies typically have very different ways of understanding and expressing their emotions and tend to focus on different elements of the emotional dynamics of relationships. This can lead to a lot of misunderstandings and frustration. 3 Trees tend to understand the emotional terrain in a very intuitive way. Heaven Energies, on the other hand, tend to be more rational and focus on the ethical and moral aspects. 3 Trees can often find it quite challenging and even exhausting to accurately convey their emotions in a language that can be understood by 6 Metals. However, as Metal Energy controls Tree Energy, it is usually the Tree Energy that ends up the most exhausted from this struggle. To sensitive Tree Energies, it can often feel as though they are being patronised or even bullied by Metal Energies. This can often result in them getting very upset and defensive. It is not uncommon for Metal Energies to find the emotional reactions of Tree Energies childish. However, this typically stems from a misunderstanding of the difference in emotional sensitivity between the two Energies. However, some Heaven Energies express a much more intuitive nature, compared to 7 Metal Energies. In this instance, there can be a much more natural and effortless emotional understanding betwen the two Energies.
</p>
<p>
    Despite the Challenging Transformation present in this relationship, 6 Metals and 3 Tree people often get on pretty well. Conversation between these two Energies can be quite lively and invigorating and despite the likelihood of frequent disagreements, both parties can learn a lot from one another.
</p>
<p>
    Both Heaven and Thunder Energies can be quite bold in the way they communicate. Heaven Energies can also be quite sharp. This could potentially lead to conflict. Thunders can also be quite blunt and insensitive at times in the way they express themselves verbally. There is a chance that {Person1} could frequently trigger {Person2} with their lack of tact, resulting in their being scolded. This is an area that will likely need to be addressed in the relationship. Both {Person1} and {Person2} are Yang Energies, which can increase the risk of them clashing, whilst typically leading to less personal chemistry and complementarity.
