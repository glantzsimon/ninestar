    This is potentially quite a challenging combination. However, there is a potential for good relationship chemistry and for a lot of personal growth.

<h5>
    Challenges
</h5>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} and {Person2} are in a Challenging Transformation, with {Person2} challenging or controlling {Person1}. This can increase the likelihood of conflict and misunderstandings. The challenging Energy ({Person2}) needs to take care not to dominate in the relationship.
</p>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} is a 3 Tree Energy and is likely to be very energetic, changeable and even impulsive and explosive at times. {Person2Proper}, on the other hand, is a Lake Energy and is more pragmatic and rational. This could result in some relationship conflict from time to time.
</p>
<p>
    Theses two Energies represent the full force of the season associated with their Energy, in this case Spring and Autumn. This polarity tends to create a very magnetic and dynamic connection. The converstion often flows very freely between these two Energies and can get quite intense at times. However, despite the great banter and chemistry in this combination, there is a risk that the Thunder Energy ({Person1}) can, at times, feel overly criticised or contradicted by {Person2}. Metal Energies tend to be very rational thinkers and often feel compelled to queston and pick apart many of the ideas expressed by Tree Energies. Care must be taken not to be overly harsh and relentless in the way they express their opinions, as this can result in Tree people growing tired and losing confidence in themselves. The image of an overly pruned Tree comes to mind.
</p>
<p>
    Another issue that often arises in this combination is that the steadier, more reliable Metal Energy ({Person2}) can find the unpredictable, changeable nature of Thunder quite disruptive and stressful at times. In order for this not to become a serious issue in the relationship, both parties would need to work together to find a common ground and, as always, communication is the key.
</p>
<p>
    An area of great potential frustration in this combination can be conflict resolution, especially when there are strong emotions. Lake and Thunder Energies typically have very different ways of understanding and expressing their emotions and tend to focus on different elements of the emotional dynamics of relationships. This can lead to a lot of misunderstandings and frustration. 3 Trees tend to understand the emotional terrain in a very intuitive visual way. Lakes, on the other hand, tend to be more rational and focus on the ethical and moral aspects. 3 Trees can often find it quite challenging and even exhausting to accurately convey their emotions in a language that can be understood by Lakes. However, as Metal Energy controls Tree Energy, it is usually the Tree Energy that ends up the most exhausted from this struggle. To sensitive Tree Energies, it can often feel as though they are being patronised or even bullied by Metal Energies. This can often result in them getting very upset and defensive. It is not uncommon for Metal Energies to find the emotional reactions of Tree Energies childish. However, this typically stems from a misunderstanding of the difference in emotional sensitivity between the two Energies.
</p>
<p>
    Thunder Energies can be quite bold in the way they communicate. Lakes, on the other hand, can be quite sharp, at times. This could potentially lead to conflict. Thunders can also be quite blunt and insensitive at times in the way they express themselves verbally. There is a chance that {Person1} could frequently trigger {Person2} with their lack of tact, resulting in {Gender1PossessivePronoun} being told off. This is an area that will likely need to be addressed in the relationship.
</p>

<h5>
    Strengths
</h5>
<p>
    Lake Energies are generally much more laid-back and rather gentler than 6 Metal Energies and so {Person2} is likely to have a gentle, stabilising effect on {Person1}. Thunder Energies are known to get a bit carried away and develop unrealistic or grandiose ideas. Lake Energies' steady, pragmatic nature along with their strong, rational minds can be of huge benefit to Thunder Energies, helping to ground and refine their visions.
</p>
<p>
    Tree Energies require a lot of practical support, especially on an everyday basis, as they are often moving about all over the place. The solid, steady, pracitcal nature of 7 Metal Energies can be immensely supportive to Tree Energies.
</p>
<p>
    Both Lake and Thunder Energies generally love to their hair down and enjoy themselves. There is a tremendous potential for fun and games with this combination. However, care must be taken as this couple could easily get carried away and become overly hedonistic.
</p>
<p>
    Despite the Challenging Transformation present in this relationship, 7 Metals and 3 Tree people often get on quite well. Conversation between these two Energies can be quite lively and invigorating and despite the likelihood of frequent disagreements, both parties can learn a lot from one another.
