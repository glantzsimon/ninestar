    This is potentially a very harmonious and exciting combination. The Fundamental Energies are in a Supportive Transformation, with {Person1} supporting {Person2}. There is also potential for good sexual chemistry and for personal growth. Conflict is less likely in this combination, but not impossible.

    Both 3 Tree and Fire Energies can be very energetic, changeable and even impulsive at times. This can either work very well, leading to an exciting, dynamic relationship with plenty of spontaneity and adventure. On the flip side, there is a risk of heated arguments, tantrums and ups and downs. Nevertheless, as these Energies are in a Supportive Transformation, it is more likely to be a harmonious connection.

<p>
    Fire Energies often need to feel appreciated and 3 Tree Energies, being possibly the most verbally expressive of the nine Energies, are very good at providing plenty of recognition, encouragement and compliments. Indeed, Trees provide "wood" to keep the fire burning. The expressive, complimentary nature of 3 Tree Energies can often bring out the best in Fire Energies. In return, Fires' quick wit and dynamic minds are usually able to keep up with 3 Trees, whose quick-paced, exploratory minds, which like to branch off in many different directions, can sometimes leave the other Energies a bit lost or perplexed.
</p>
<p>
    Another source of harmony in this combination is that both 3 Trees and Fires tend to be quite intuitive with high emotional sensitivity and intelligence. This enables them to understand one another without having to go to great lengths to explain what they are feeling and why.
</p>
<p>
    Fire Energies can be pretty liberal and enlightened. However, when out of balance, they can be vein, self-centred and overly critical. 3 Tree are particularly sensitive to criticism and this could lead to discord in the relationship.
</p>
<p>
    3 Trees, when out of balance, can get quite carried away and develop grandiose and unrealistic ideas. Fire Energies can be very helpful in this regard, as their clarity and strong intuition can help to centre and balance 3 Trees' ideas and vision.

    {Person1Proper} and {Person2} are in a Supportive Transformation, which typically results in little conflict and a much deeper sense of harmony, and mutual respect and understanding.

<p>
    In a Supportive Transformation or Parent / Child relationship, the supported Energy (in this case {Person2}) needs to take care not to take the 'parent' for granted. If an imbalance starts to appear, the parent Energy may grow resentful and pull away.
