    This is potentially a very harmonious and exciting combination. Conflict is less likely in this combination.

<h5>
    Strengths
</h5>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} and {Person2} are in a Supportive Transformation, with {Person1} supporting {Person2}. This type of combination typically leads to greater harmony and mutual understanding.
</p>
<p>
    Both 3 Tree and Fire Energies can be very energetic, changeable and even impulsive at times. This can often lead to an exciting, dynamic relationship with plenty of spontaneity and adventure.
</p>
<p>
    Fire Energies often need to feel appreciated and 3 Tree Energies, being possibly the most verbally expressive of the nine Energies, are very good at providing plenty of recognition, encouragement and compliments. Indeed, Trees provide "wood" to keep the fire burning. The expressive, complimentary nature of 3 Tree Energies can often bring out the best in Fire Energies. In return, Fires' quick wit and dynamic minds are usually able to keep up with 3 Trees, whose quick-paced, exploratory minds, which like to branch off in many different directions, can sometimes leave the other Energies a bit lost or perplexed.
</p>
<p>
    Both 3 Trees and Fires tend to be quite intuitive with high emotional sensitivity and intelligence. This enables them to understand one another without having to go to great lengths to explain what they are feeling and why.
</p>
<p>
    3 Trees, when out of balance, can get quite carried away and develop grandiose and unrealistic ideas. Fire Energies can be very helpful in this regard, as their clarity and strong intuition can help to centre and balance 3 Trees' ideas and vision.
</p>

<h5>
    Challenges
</h5>
<p>
    As both of these Energies are quite energetic and impulsie, there is a risk of occasional heated arguments, tantrums and ups and downs. Nevertheless, as these Energies are in a Supportive Transformation, it is unlikely to be a significant issue.
</p>
<p>
    Fire Energies can be pretty liberal and enlightened. However, when out of balance, they can be vein, self-centred and overly critical. 3 Tree are particularly sensitive to criticism and this could lead to discord in the relationship.
</p>
<p>
    In a Supportive Transformation or Parent / Child relationship, the supported Energy (in this case {Person2}) needs to take care not to take the 'parent' for granted. If an imbalance starts to appear, the parent Energy may grow resentful and pull away.
