    Strengths
</h5>
<p>
    Both people share the same Solar Energy "Wind". Wind energies often enjoy each other's company as they are quite talkative by nature, but are equally receptive and good listeners. This tends to create very enjoyable conversation.

    Both people are full of energy and spontaneity and are likely to enjoy lots of different activities together. Being typically more reliable and thoughtful than Thunder energies, there is a strong likelihood of these two people creating deep trust in one another.

<p>
    Wind energies are typically very sensitive to music, literature and the arts and this could result in a number of shared interests, which could be immensely enjoyable and rewarding.

<h5>
    Challenges
</h5>
<p>
    As both parties are Wind energies, there is an increased risk of getting carried away and being overly gullible or lacking critical thinking. It is usually a good idea to run things past other energies and elements before embarking on a new project.

<p>
    Both energies are pretty energetic and there is an increased risk of wearing one another out. This may mean that they find it harder to spend long periods of time together without it leading to exhaustion.
</p>
<p>
    As both energies share the same Solar Energy, there are generally many more similarities between them, which can lead to decreased magnetism and potential for challenge and growth.
