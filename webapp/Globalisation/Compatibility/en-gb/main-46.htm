    This is potentially quite a challenging combination. However, there is a potential for good relationship chemistry and for personal growth.

<h5>
    Challenges
</h5>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} and {Person2} are in a Challenging Transformation, with {Person2} challenging or controlling {Person1}. This can increase the likelihood of conflict and misunderstandings. The challenging Energy ({Person2}) needs to take care not to dominate in the relationship.
</p>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} is a 4 Tree Energy and is likely to be very energetic, changeable and even impulsive and explosive at times. {Person2Proper}, on the other hand, is a Heaven Energy and is more reserved, pragmatic and single-minded. This could be perceived as overly rigid and cautious by {Person1} and could be source of much frustration.
</p>
<p>
    What can often happen in this combination is that the Wind Energy ({Person1}) can feel overly controlled and criticised by {Person2}. Metal Energies tend to be very rational thinkers and often feel compelled to contradict and possibly pick apart many of the ideas expressed by Tree Energies. Metal's feedback can be very valuable to Tree Energies, as it can help to refine their ideas and visions; however, care must be taken not to be overly harsh and relentless in the way they express their opinions, as this can result in Tree people losing confidence in themselves. The image of an overly pruned Tree comes to mind.
</p>
<p>
    Another issue that often arises in this combination is that the steadier, more reliable Metal Energy ({Person2}) can find the unpredictable, changeable nature of Wind quite disruptive and stressful. In order for this not to become a serious issue in the relationship, both parties would need to work together to find a common ground and, as always, communication is the key.
</p>
<p>
    Metal Energy controls Tree Energy, and therefore, whenever there is conflict between these two Energies, it is usually the Tree Energy that ends up the most exhausted. To sensitive Tree Energies, it can often feel as though they are being patronised or even bullied by Metal Energies. This can often result in them getting very upset and defensive. It is not uncommon for Metal Energies to find the emotional reactions of Tree Energies childish, although this is more often the case with Thunder Energies. However, this typically stems from a misunderstanding of the difference in emotional sensitivity between the two Energies. However, some Heaven Energies express a much more intuitive nature, compared to 7 Metal Energies. In this instance, there can be a much more natural and effortless emotional understanding between the two Energies.

<h5>
    Strengths
</h5>
<p>
    {Person2Proper}'s steady, pragmatic nature could be very beneficial to {Person1}, providing structure and grounding. Wind Energies are known to get a bit carried away and can benefit greatly from having their visions grounded. However, this is much less of an issue with 4 Trees than it is with 3 Trees, as they generally have a steadier, more pragmatic and thoughtful nature.
</p>
<p>
    Conversely, {Person1} can help {Person2} to loosen up and be less rigid. When done tact and sensitiviy, this can be immensely helpful to Heaven Energies, who sometimes need to be reminded to let their hair down.
</p>
<p>
    Despite the Challenging Transformation present in this relationship, the conversation between these two Energies can be quite lively and invigorating and even in the likelihood of frequent disagreements, both parties can learn a lot from one another.
</p>
<p>
    Heaven Energies can be quite bold in the way they communicate. Heaven Energies can also be quite sharp. This could potentially lead to conflict. However, Winds tend to be quite thoughtful communicators and the likelihood of conflict escalating into rows is perhaps less than with 3 Trees. {Person1Proper} is Yin whereas {Person2} is Yang, which creates complementarity in the relationship, as well as greater personal chemistry.
