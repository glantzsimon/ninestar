    This is potentially quite a challenging combination. However, there is a potential for good relationship chemistry and for a lot of personal growth.

<h5>
    Challenges
</h5>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} and {Person2} are in a Challenging Transformation, with {Person2} challenging or controlling {Person1}. This can increase the likelihood of conflict and misunderstandings. The challenging Energy ({Person2}) needs to take care not to dominate in the relationship.
</p>
<p>
    Theses two Energies represent the full force of the season associated with their Energy, in this case Spring and Autumn. This polarity tends to create a very magnetic and dynamic connection. The converstion often flows very freely between these two Energies and can get quite intense at times. However, despite the great banter and chemistry in this combination, there is a risk that the Wind Energy ({Person1}) can, at times, feel overly criticised or contradicted by {Person2}. Metal Energies tend to be very rational thinkers and often feel compelled to queston and pick apart many of the ideas expressed by Tree Energies. Metal's feedback can be very valuable to Tree Energies, as it can help to refine their ideas and visions; however, care must be taken not to be overly harsh and relentless in the way they express their opinions, as this can result in Tree people growing tired and also losing confidence in themselves. The image of an overly pruned Tree comes to mind.
</p>
<p>
    Another issue that often arises in this combination is that the steadier, more reliable Metal Energy ({Person2}) can find the unpredictable, changeable nature of Wind quite disruptive and stressful at times. However, this is less of an issue with Wind Energies, than it is with Thunders, as they are typically more grounded, thoughtful and pragmatic than their 3 Tree counterparts.
</p>
<p>
    Metal Energy controls Tree Energy and therefore, whenever there is conflict between these two Energies, it is usually the Tree Energy that ends up the most exhausted. To sensitive Tree Energies, it can often feel as though they are being patronised or even bullied by Metal Energies. This can often result in them getting very upset and defensive. It is not uncommon for Metal Energies to find the emotional reactions of Tree Energies childish, although this is more often the case with Thunder Energies. However, this typically stems from a misunderstanding of the difference in emotional sensitivity between the two Energies.
</p>
<p>
    Lakes can be quite sharp, at times, in the way they communicate, which can be hurtful to sensitive Wind Energies. This could potentially lead to conflict.
</p>
<p>
    Both {Person1} and {Person2} are Yin, which tends to lead to less complementarity in the relationship and can sometimes lead to stagnation.
</p>

<h5>
    Strengths
</h5>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} is a 4 Tree Energy and is likely to be lively, changeable and even impulsive at times. {Person2Proper}, on the other hand, is a 7 Metal Energy and is more pragmatic and rational. This could result in some relationship conflict from time to time; however, Lake Energies are generally much more laid-back and rather gentler than 6 Metal Energies and so {Person2} is likely to have a gentle, grounding effect on {Person1}. Equally, 4 Trees are typically less reactive and explosive than 3 Trees, so overall there is a calmer nature to this relationship.
</p>
<p>
    {Person2Proper}'s steady, pragmatic nature could be very beneficial to {Person1}, providing structure and grounding. Wind Energies are known to get a bit carried away and can benefit greatly from having their visions grounded. However, this is much less of an issue with Wind Energies than it is with Thunders.
</p>
<p>
    Despite the Challenging Transformation present in this relationship, 7 Metals and 4 Tree people often get on quite well. 4 Trees tend to be a bit more rational and pragmatic than 3 Trees, which can make it communcation between them and 7 Metals a little easier. Indeed, conversation between these two Energies can be quite deep and stimulating and despite the risk of occasional disagreements, both parties can learn a lot from one another.
</p>
<p>
    Winds tend to be quite thoughtful communicators, and even though some conflict is likely in this combination, due to its challenging nature, it is less likely to escalate into rows than with 3 Trees.
