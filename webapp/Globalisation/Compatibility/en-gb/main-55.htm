    This is a generally harmonious combination with good potential for friendship. However, conflict may arise if both parties wish to take the lead.

<h5>
    Strengths
</h5>
<p>
    There is a potential for great trust to be formed in this relationship. Both parties are typically reliable and supportive and when that goes both ways, great friendships are often the result.
</p>
<p>
    There is also a great potential for mutual understanding and compassion. This can be tremendously helpful to 5 Earths as they frequently experience ups and downs in life.
</p>

<h5>
    Challenges
</h5>
<p>
    5 Earth people typially like to be at the centre of everything they do and are very group-oriented. As both people are Core Earth Energies, on the one hand, they may be able to work well together and support one another; however, it can also go the other way and conflict could arise if both parties want to take the lead.
</p>
<p>
    Core Earth Energies can be over-ambitious and unpractical at times, and if both parties share this tendency, there is a risk they could make things worse and really get carried away. However, there is also a very practical, down-to-Earth side of 5 Earth energies, so they could equally help each other to adopt a more pragmatic approach.
</p>
<p>
    As both Energies share the same Fundamental Energy, there are generally many more similarities between them, which can lead to decreased magnetism and potential for challenge and growth.
