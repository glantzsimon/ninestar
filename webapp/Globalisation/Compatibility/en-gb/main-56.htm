    This is potentially a very harmonious combination, as the Fundamental Energies are in a Supportive Transformation, with {Person1} supporting {Person2}. There is also potential for good sexual chemistry and for personal growth. There is not a high risk of conflict in this combination, but due to the bold nature of both Energies, some could arise from time to time.

<p>
    {Person1Proper} is a Core Earth  Energy and is most likely stable, reliable and supportive.

    {Person2Proper} is a Heaven Energy. 6 Metals generally have a bold, moral and assertive nature and like to take the lead. This could potentially poses a problem for 5 Core Earth Energies, as they also quite like to take the lead, resulting in potential conflict. {Person2} needs to be careful that they don't become overly domineering and take {Person1}'s supportive nature for granted. Both Energies will probably need to frequently negotiate and agree on who will take care of what, so that their potential bossy natures don't clash.
</p>
<p>
    {Person2Proper}, being a 6 Metal Energy, is likely to be quite pragmatic and rational in the way {Gender2Pronoun} operates. Sometimes this borders on the overly cautious. {Person1Proper}, on the other hand, can be a little impulsive and reckless at times, which could be a source of conflict in the relationship.
</p>
<p>
    Both 6 Metal Energies and Core Earths are quite grounded and reliable. In addition, both Energies usually have a strong sense of direction and purpose. These two Energies can make a great team, both in relationships and at work. However, communication is key.
</p>
<p>
    {Person2Proper} has a tendency to withdraw and be reserved at times. Similarly, {Person1Proper} can be quite single-minded and work-obsessed. This could create distance and lack of communication and intimacy between them. However, both have the potentially to be very loyal to their partners.
</p>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} and {Person2} are in a Supportive Transformation, which typically results in little conflict and a much deeper sense of harmony and mutual respect. 6 Metals can be overbearing at times, and Core Earths can be pretty bold and domineering. However, both can be very committed to their partners and typically have the patience and resilience to tolerate one another's faults and work through any issues that arise.

<p>
    In a Supportive Transformation or Parent / Child relationship, the supported Energy (in this case {Person2}) needs to take care not to take the 'parent' for granted. If an imbalance starts to appear, the parent Energy may grow resentful and pull away.
