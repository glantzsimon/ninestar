    This is potentially quite a harmonious and complementary combination, however some conflict could arise if both parties wish to take the lead.

<h5>
    Strengths
</h5>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} and {Person2} are in a Supportive Transformation, which typically results in little conflict and a much deeper sense of harmony and mutual respect.
</p>
<p>
    Both 6 Metal Energies and Core Earths are quite grounded and reliable. In addition, both Energies usually have a strong sense of direction and purpose. These two Energies can make a great team, both in relationships and at work.
</p>
<p>
    Both Energies have the potentially to be very loyal to their partners.
</p>
<p>
    6 Metals can be overbearing at times, and Core Earths can be pretty bold and domineering. However, both can be very committed to their partners and typically have the patience and resilience to tolerate one another's faults and work through any issues that arise.
</p>

<h5>
    Challenges
</h5>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} is a Core Earth  Energy and is most likely stable, reliable and supportive.

    {Person2Proper} is a Heaven Energy. 6 Metals generally have a bold, moral and assertive nature and like to take the lead. This could potentially pose a problem for 5 Core Earth Energies, as they also quite like to take the lead.
</p>
<p>
    {Person2Proper} needs to be careful that they don't become overly domineering and take {Person1}'s supportive nature for granted. Both Energies will probably need to frequently negotiate and agree on who will take care of what, so that their potential bossy natures don't clash.
</p>
<p>
    {Person2Proper}, being a 6 Metal Energy, is likely to be quite pragmatic and rational in the way {Gender2Pronoun} operates. Sometimes this borders on the overly cautious. {Person1Proper}, on the other hand, can be a little impulsive and reckless at times, which could be a source of conflict in the relationship.
</p>
<p>
    {Person2Proper} has a tendency to withdraw and be reserved at times. Similarly, {Person1Proper} can be quite single-minded and work-obsessed. This could create distance and lack of communication and intimacy between them.
</p>
<p>
    In a Supportive Transformation or Parent / Child relationship, the supported Energy (in this case {Person2}) needs to take care not to take the 'parent' for granted. If an imbalance starts to appear, the parent Energy may grow resentful and pull away.
