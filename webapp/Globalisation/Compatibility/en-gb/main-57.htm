<h5>
    This is potentially a very harmonious combination, as the Fundamental Energies are in a Supportive Transformation, with {Person1} supporting {Person2}. There is also potential for good sexual chemistry and for personal growth. There is not a high risk of conflict in this combination.

<p>
    {Person2Proper} is a Lake Energy. 7 Metals generally have a laid-back nature and are happy to go with the flow. This can potentially work quite harmoniously with 5 Core Earth Energies, who typically like to take the lead. 
</p>
<p>
    Core Earth Energies are typically stable, reliable and supportive. Lakes are also fairly grounded and reliable and so this is another area in which these two Energies are well matched. However, {Person2}, when out of balance, can sometimes become lazy and needs to be careful that {Gender2Pronoun} doesn't take {Person1}'s supportive nature for granted.
</p>
<p>
    {Person2Proper} is likely to be quite pragmatic and rational in the way {Gender2Pronoun} operates. {Person1Proper}, on the other hand, can be a little impulsive and reckless at times, which could be a source of conflict in the relationship. However, {Person2} can offer tremendous support to {Person1} in this regard and likely has the diplomacy and articulacy to communicate any suggestions in a way that can be received (5 Earth Energies are notoriously resistant to advice from others).
</p>
<p>
    These two Energies can make a great team, both in relationships and at work. Core Earths like to take the lead, as a rule, and 7 Metal Energies make reliable and supportive partners, with their easy-going and helpful nature.
</p>
<p>
    {Person2Proper} may have a tendency to withdraw and be reserved at times. Similarly, {Person1Proper} can be quite single-minded and work-obsessed. This could create distance and lack of communication and intimacy between them. It is important for both parties to make an effort to communicate and to make the effort to prioritise spending time together, in order to minimise the chances of them growing apart.
</p>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} and {Person2} are in a Supportive Transformation, which typically results in little conflict and a much deeper sense of harmony and mutual respect. Core Earths can be pretty bold and domineering at times, however 7 Metals are pretty laid-back as a whole and are more likely to be able to accomodate these tendencies than other Energies. Core Earths can be very committed to their partners, but they need to make sure they take time out of work to spend with their partner. 7 Metals usually take quite a bit longer to commit, as they love their independence. Nevertheless, there is a great potential for a healthy, balanced relationship.

<p>
    In a Supportive Transformation or Parent / Child relationship, the supported Energy (in this case {Person2}) needs to take care not to take the 'parent' for granted. If an imbalance starts to appear, the parent Energy may grow resentful and pull away.
