    This is likely to be a fairly harmonious combination with good potential for friendship. However, conflict may arise from both parties wanting to take the lead.

<h5>
    Strengths
</h5>
<p>
    There is a potential for great trust to be formed in this relationship. Both parties are typically reliable, loyal, steady and pragmatic and are likely to appreciate these qualities in one another.
</p>
<p>
    There is also a great potential for mutual understanding and compassion. However, it is likely to be an unspoken mutual understanding, as Heaven energies can be rather reserved, especially when it comes to expressing deeper feelings.
</p>

<h5>
    Challenges
</h5>
<p>
    Both people are Heaven energies and as such are naturally authoritative. This could go in two directions. On the one hand, if there is mutual respect, then a strong bond may be formed. Howver, it could equally lead to rivalry and friction.
</p>
<p>
    Heaven energies are typically quite moral and noble and therefore these two individuals are likely to see eye-to-eye on many different topics. Care must also be taken not to encourage one another to become overly intolerant, self-righteous and judgmental. It is advisable for this pair to frequently seek the input of Yin energies, as 6 Metals do not have any Yin in their chart.
</p>
<p>
    There is a possibility that both parties are quite influencial within their circles, be it in the family or wider community. 6 Metals prefer to take the lead, rather than taking advice from others. Therefore, care should be taken not to tread on each other's toes
</p>
<p>
    As both energies share the same Solar Energy, there are generally many more similarities between them, which can lead to decreased magnetism and potential for challenge and growth.
