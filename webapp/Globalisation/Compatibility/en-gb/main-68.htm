    This is potentially quite a harmonious combination; however both parties can have quite a bold character, increasing the risk of clashing.

</p>

<h5>
    Challenges
</h5>
<p>
    {Person2Proper} is a Heaven Energy. 6 Metals generally have a bold, moral and assertive nature and like to take the lead. This may pose a problem for {Person2}, who is a Mountain Energy and could also resent being bossed about and reveal quite a stubborn side. {Person1} needs to be careful that they don't become overly domineering and take {Person1}'s supportive nature for granted. This could lead to resentment and conflict.
</p>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} is quite pragmatic and rational in the way {Gender1Pronoun} operates. Sometimes this borders on the overly cautious. {Person2} shares this trait with {Person1} and therefore there could be a risk of these tendencies being exacerbated, leading to further imbalance.
</p>
<p>
    Both {Person1} and {Person2} share the tendency to withdraw and be reserved at times.  This could create distance and lack of communication and intimacy between them, at times. However, they are likely to understand one another if one person withdraws.
</p>
<p>
    6 Metals can be overbearing at times, which could be a source of conflict in the relationship, but Mountains typically have the patience and resilience to tolerate this tendency, whilst simultaneously posessing the strength of character to challenge it, when felt necessary.
</p>
<p>
    In a Supportive Transformation or Parent / Child relationship, the supported Energy (in this case {Person1}) needs to take care not to take the 'parent' for granted. If an imbalance starts to appear, the parent Energy may grow resentful and pull away.
