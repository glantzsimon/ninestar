    This is potentially quite a harmonious combination, as the Fundamental Energies are in a Supportive Transformation, with {Person2} supporting {Person1}. There is also potential for reasonable sexual chemistry and for personal growth. Conflict is less likely, but still possible in this combination, as both parties can have quite a bold character.

<p>
    {Person1Proper} is a Mountain Energy and is most likely stable, reliable and supportive.

    {Person2Proper} is a Heaven Energy. 6 Metals generally have a bold, moral and assertive nature and like to take the lead. This may or may not pose a problem for {Person2}. Mountains can be very supportive, however it's also possible that {Person1}'s bold, assertive nature could clash with {Person2}, bringing out {Gender2PossessivePronoun} more stubborn side. {Person1} needs to be careful that they don't become overly domineering and take {Person1}'s supportive nature for granted. This could lead to resentment and conflict.
</p>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} is quite pragmatic and rational in the way {Gender1Pronoun} operates. Sometimes this borders on the overly cautious. {Person2} shares this trait with {Person1} and therefore there could be a risk of these tendencies being exacerbated, leading to further imbalance.
</p>
<p>
    Both 6 Metal Energies and Mountains are quite grounded and reliable. In addition, both Energies usually have a strong sense of direction and purpose. These two Energies make a great team, both in relationships and at work.

<p>
    Both {Person1} and {Person2} share the tendency to withdraw and be reserved at times.  This could create distance and lack of communication and intimacy between them, at times. However, they are likely to understand one another if one person withdraws. Both have the potentially to be very loyal to their partners.
</p>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} and {Person2} are in a Supportive Transformation, which typically results in little conflict and a much deeper sense of harmony and mutual respect. 6 Metals can be overbearing at times, but Mountains typically have the patience and resilience to tolerate this tendency, but equally the strength of character to challenge it, when felt necessary.

<p>
    In a Supportive Transformation or Parent / Child relationship, the supported Energy (in this case {Person1}) needs to take care not to take the 'parent' for granted. If an imbalance starts to appear, the parent Energy may grow resentful and pull away.
