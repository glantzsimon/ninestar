    This is potentially a harmonious and stable combination; however, both parties have strong personalities, which may increase the risk of power struggles.
</h5>

<h5>Strengths</h5>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} and {Person2} are in a Supportive Transformation, with {Person2} supporting {Person1}. This type of relationship typically fosters greater harmony, trust, and mutual understanding.
</p>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} is a Mountain Energy—stable, grounded, and dependable. These qualities are deeply appreciated by Heaven energies and help to establish a solid foundation of respect and reliability.
</p>
<p>
    Both Mountains and Heaven energies are pragmatic and goal-oriented, often with a strong inner sense of purpose and direction. They are well suited to collaborate, whether in a partnership, friendship, or professional context.
</p>
<p>
    Loyalty is a core trait shared by both energies. When these two feel aligned, they are likely to remain committed and supportive, especially through life's more serious or challenging moments.
</p>

<h5>Challenges</h5>
<p>
    {Person2Proper} is a Heaven Energy—assertive, principled, and often naturally inclined to lead. This may clash with {Person1Proper}'s own independent and sometimes stubborn nature as a Mountain Energy. If either party becomes too fixed or controlling, it could trigger frustration or emotional distancing.
</p>
<p>
    Both individuals are typically rational and pragmatic, but this shared caution may sometimes reinforce a tendency to overthink or hesitate. Without enough emotional spontaneity or intuitive input, the relationship could become overly rigid or uninspired.
</p>
<p>
    Both {Person1} and {Person2} tend to be reserved and self-contained. While this can result in mutual respect for each other’s space, it may also lead to emotional distance or lack of open communication, especially during moments when connection is most needed.
</p>
<p>
    6 Metal energies can be quite direct and, at times, overbearing. While Mountains have the strength and inner stability to tolerate this, they may eventually push back—firmly and silently—if they feel taken for granted or dismissed.
</p>
<p>
    In a Supportive Transformation or Parent–Child dynamic, the supported energy (in this case, {Person1}) should also be mindful not to lean too heavily on the other. If the balance of giving and receiving shifts too far, the 'parent' energy may become fatigued and withdraw.
