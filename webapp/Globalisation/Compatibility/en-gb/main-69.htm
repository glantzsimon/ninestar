    This is potentially quite a challenging combination. However, there is a potential for good relationship chemistry and for personal growth.

<h5>
    Challenges
</h5>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} and {Person2} are in a Challenging Transformation, with {Person2} challenging or controlling {Person1}. This can increase the likelihood of conflict and misunderstandings. The challenging Energy ({Person2}) needs to take care not to dominate in the relationship.
</p>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} is a Heaven Energy. 6 Metals generally have a bold, moral and assertive nature and like to take the lead. It's possible that {Person1}'s bold, assertive nature could clash with {Person2}, bringing out {Gender2PossessivePronoun} more proud nature. {Person1Proper} needs to be careful that {Gender1Pronoun} doesn't become overly domineering, as this could lead conflict.
</p>
<p>
    A common problem with this combination is that both Heaven and Fire energies can be simultaneously quite critical and yet neither likes to receive criticism. This can be a significant source of conflict in the relationship. Both parties will need to learn to be tactful and receptive to each other's points of view.
</p>
<p>
    Another issue that often arises in this combination is that the steadier, more reliable Metal Energy ({Person1}) can find the unpredictable, impulsive nature of Fire quite disruptive and stressful at times. In order for this not to become a serious issue in the relationship, both parties would need to work together to find a common ground and, as always, communication is the key.
</p>
<p>
    An area of potential frustration in this combination can be conflict resolution, especially when there are strong emotions. Heaven and Fire energies typically have very different ways of understanding and expressing their emotions and tend to focus on different elements of the emotional dynamics of relationships. This can lead to a lot of misunderstandings and frustration. Fire energies tend to understand the emotional terrain in a very intuitive way. Heaven energies, on the other hand, tend to be more rational and focus on the ethical and moral aspects. However, Fire's brilliant clarity and intuition coupled with their excellent communication skills is likely to be quite beneficial to {Person1}. The Fire element controls Metal, which can result in a gentle melting and softening of the more rigid metallic nature.

    Strengths
</h5>
<p>
    {Person1Proper}'s steadier, more pragmatic nature could be very beneficial to {Person2}, providing structure and grounding, as Fires are not especially practical.
</p>
<p>
    Conversely, {Person2} can help {Person1} to loosen up and be less rigid. When done tact and sensitiviy, this can be immensely helpful to Heaven energies, who sometimes need to be reminded to let their hair down.
</p>
<p>
    Despite the Challenging Transformation present in this relationship, 6 Metals and Fires often get on pretty well. Conversation between these two energies can be quite lively and invigorating and despite the likelihood of frequent disagreements, both parties can learn a lot from one another.
