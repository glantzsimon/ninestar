    This has the potential to be a very harmonious combination. However, it might be better suited to friendship than romance.
</h5>

<h5>
    Strengths
</h5>
<p>
    Both people are Lake Energies and as such are naturally laid-back and enjoy many of the same kinds of activities and interests and are fun-loving. This is a recipe for a very enjoyable friendship!
</p>
<p>
    Both people have a great sense of optimism and are both great communicators and listeners. This typically results in an extremely civilised and balanced relationship in which both parties feel listened to and acknowleded.
</p>
<p>
    There is a potential for great trust to be formed in this relationship. Both parties are typically reliable, steady and pragmatic and are likely to appreciate these qualities in one another.
</p>
<p>
    There is also a great potential for mutual understanding and compassion. However, as Metal Energies are generally more reserved about expressing their deeper feelings, it may be that this mutual respect and appreciation is simply "felt", but not necessarily expressed verbally.
</p>

<h5>
    Challenges
</h5>
<p>
    Lake Energies can also be reserved at times, even aloof. This could potentially cause some stagnation in the relationship if one or both parties pulls away and neither make the first move to re-establish a connection. 
</p>
<p>
    Another potential pitfall to this combination is for the more hedonistic side of Lake Energies to get exacerbated, resulting in an increased risk of overindulgence and laziness. However, by and large, this is likely to be a very harmonious and healthy relationship.
</p>
<p>
    As both Energies share the same Fundamental Energy, there are generally many more similarities between them, which can lead to decreased magnetism and potential for challenge and growth.
