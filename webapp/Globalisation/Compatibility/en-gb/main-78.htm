    This is potentially quite a harmonious combination. There is also potential for good personal growth. Conflict is typically not much of an issue.

<h5>
    Strengths
</h5>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} and {Person2} are in a Supportive Transformation, with {Person2} supporting {Person1}. This type of combination typically leads to greater harmony and mutual understanding.
</p>
<p>
    {Person2Proper} is a Mountain Energy. Mountains are typically stable, reliable and supportive.

    {Person1Proper} is a Lake. Lake Energies are also pretty stable and reliable and are generally laid-back and flexbible. This combination is usually quite a harmonious one.
</p>
<p>
    Both 7 Metal Energies and Mountains are quite grounded, pragmatic and rational. In addition, both Energies usually have a strong sense of direction and purpose. These two Energies make a great team, both in relationships and at work.
</p>
<p>
    Mountains are especially prone to going into their "caves"; however, the more fun-loving side {Person1}'s Lake nature could help to bring a greater sense of joy and leisure to {Person2}'s more serious nature.
</p>

<h5>
    Challenges
</h5>
<p>
    Both {Person1} and {Person2} share the tendency to withdraw and be reserved at times.  This could create distance and lack of communication and intimacy between them, at times. However, they are likely to understand one another if one person withdraws. 
</p>
<p>
    In a Supportive Transformation or Parent / Child relationship, the supported Energy (in this case {Person1}) needs to take care not to take the 'parent' for granted. If an imbalance starts to appear, the parent Energy may grow resentful and pull away.
</p>
<p>
    Lake and Mountain Energies are both pretty rational in their thinking. The absence of more intuitive, emotional energy, which one finds with Fire, Water and Tree Energies, for example, could potentially lead to an imbalance and a tendency towards over rationality, skepticism and narrow-mindedness.
