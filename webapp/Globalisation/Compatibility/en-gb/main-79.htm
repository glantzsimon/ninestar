    This is potentially quite a challenging combination. However, there is a potential for good relationship chemistry and for personal growth.
</h5>

<h5>
    Challenges
</h5>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} and {Person2} are in a Challenging Transformation, with {Person2} challenging or controlling {Person1}. This can increase the likelihood of conflict and misunderstandings. The challenging Energy ({Person2}) needs to take care not to dominate in the relationship.
</p>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} is a Lake Energy. 7 Metals generally have a laid-back, flexible and fun-loving nature. {Person2} is a Fire Enegy, and is likely more passionate, expressive and warm. These two Energies have quite different expressions and ways of thinking and interacting with others. Their differences can create a lot of chemistry, but can equally be the source of misunderstandings and conflict.
</p>
<p>
    A common problem with this combination is that both Lake and Fire Energies can be quite critical. Fires typically dislike receiving criticism and can be proud and easily offended. This can be a significant source of conflict in the relationship. Lakes, when overly critisied, can withdraw and become aloof and uncommunicative. Both parties will need to learn to be tactful and receptive to each other's points of view.
</p>
<p>
    Another issue that often arises in this combination is that the steadier, more reliable Metal Energy ({Person1}) can find the unpredictable, impulsive nature of Fire quite disruptive and stressful at times. In order for this not to become a serious issue in the relationship, both parties would need to work together to find a common ground and, as always, communication is the key.
</p>
<p>
    An area of potential frustration in this combination can be conflict resolution, especially when there are strong emotions. Lake and Fire Energies typically have very different ways of understanding and expressing their emotions and tend to focus on different elements of the emotional dynamics of relationships. This can lead to a lot of misunderstandings and frustration. {Person2} is likely to understand the emotional terrain in a more intuitive way. On the other hand, {Person1} is likely to be more rational and focus on the ethical and moral aspects. However, {Person2Proper}'s clarity and intuition coupled with {Gender2PossessivePronoun} excellent communication skills is likely to help to resolve any conflict. The Fire element controls Metal, which can result in a gentle melting and softening of the more rigid metallic nature.
</p>

<h5>
    Strengths
</h5>
<p>
    {Person1Proper}'s steadier, more pragmatic nature could be very beneficial to {Person2}, providing structure and grounding, as Fires are not especially practical, especially when it comes to everyday affairs.
</p>
<p>
    Lake Energies can be quite aloof at times and are not always very forthcoming when it comes to expressing appreciation. This can be an issue for Fire Energies, who like to feel appreciated and encouraged. Fires may find Lake's aloof and critical nature too cold.
</p>
<p>
    Conversely, {Person2} can help {Person1} to loosen up and be less rigid, especially with regards to certain opinions or beliefs which may appear narrow-minded or one-sided to the more open-minded and intuitive Fire. Similarly, Fire Energies are often full of enthusiasm and bright ideas and can help to motivate Lake Energies, who can, at times, become lazy and unmotivated.
</p>
<p>
    Despite the Challenging Transformation present in this relationship, 7 Metals and Fires often get on pretty well. Conversation between these two Energies can be quite lively and invigorating at times and despite the likelihood of some misunderstandings and conflict, both parties can learn a lot from one another.
