<h5>
    Strengths
</h5>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} and {Person2} are in a Supportive Transformation, with {Person2} supporting {Person1}. This type of combination typically leads to greater harmony and mutual understanding.
</p>
<p>
    {Person1Proper} is a Mountain Energy. Mountain Energies are typically stable, reliable, supportive and practical. This can be very complementary to {Person2}, who, being a Fire Energy, is likely to be more dynamic, changeable and a little impractical when it comes to everyday affairs.
</p>
<p>
    Fire Energies are quite free-spirited and spontaneous. This can bring variety and energy to the relationship and help {Person1} to loosen up and have more fun.
</p>
<p>
    Fire Energies can offer great insights, clarity and encouragement to Earth Energies and typically have the knack of communicating suggestions and ideas to Earth Energies in a way that they can receive without it triggering their stubborn side. However, it may not always work out this way.
</p>
<p>
    Both Energies also have the potentially to be very loyal to their partners.
</p>

<h5>
    Challenges
</h5>
<p>
    It's possible {Person1} could have the tendency to get obsessed with {Gender1PossessivePronoun} job or some project {Gender1Pronoun} is involved in. On the other hand, {Person2}, being a Fire Energy, would typically need more connection and to feel appreciated and could struggle if {Person1} is not very available. This could potentially create some distance and conflict in the relationship. Nevertheless, Fires are excellent communicators and this increases the chances of resolving any such issues, should they arise.
</p>
<p>
    Fire Energies are typically energetic and spontaneous and even impulsive and unpredictable. This could potentially result in frustration for both parties, as Mountain Energies can be stubborn and resistant to change not instigated by them and could find the impulsive side of Fire Energies stressful at times.
</p>
<p>
    Fire Energies can be pretty liberal and enlightened. However, when out of balance, they can be vein, self-centred and overly critical. Mountain Energies are fairly tolerant and forgiving, but {Person2} should take care not to be overly critical.
</p>
<p>
    {Person1Proper}, when out of balance, could become extremely withdrawn and uncommunicative. This could be quite challenging for Fire Energies, who often need to feel appreciated and emotionally connected to their partners.
</p>
<p>
    In a Supportive Transformation or Parent / Child relationship, the supported Energy (in this case {Person1}) needs to take care not to take the 'parent' for granted. If an imbalance starts to appear, the parent Energy may grow resentful and pull away.
