    This is a harmonious combination with great potential for friendship. The chemistry may well be lacking, however.

<h5>
    Strengths
</h5>
<p>
    As both people are Fire energies, they share many of the same qualities, such as the ability to inspire those around then with their great clarity, intuition and emotional intelligence. There is a strong potential for both people to get on very well and they would likely enjoy talking to one another and feel very comfortable in each other's company.
</p>
<p>
    Fire energies need to feel appreciated, otherwise they can lose confidence. They are also naturally warm, expressive and passionate. Therefore, in a Fire / Fire combination, it is very likely that both parties express their mutual appreciation, which could lead to a close bond.
</p>
<p>
    Being two Fire energies, there is a great potential for mutual understanding and compassion and this could be a great source of support for both parties.
</p>
<p>
    Fire energies, like Water, need their space and don't like to have their territory occupied by others for too long. This mutual tendency could potentially cause these two people to keep each other at arm's length at times; however, they would likely understand why and it is unlikely it would be a big problem.

<h5>
    Challenges
</h5>
<p>
    A potential pitfall to this combination is that, being both Fire energies, neither is especially practical when it comes to everyday affairs. This could be a source of frustration. However, the solution is usually to seek the advice of other energies where necessary.
</p>
<p>
    Sometimes Fire energies like to be the star of the show. This could lead to some rivalry if one or both parties feel the need to upstage the other. However, conflict is usually resolved quickly between Fires, albeit passionately, and they are generally quick to forgive and forget.
</p>
<p>
    As both energies share the same Solar Energy, there are generally many more similarities between them, which can lead to decreased magnetism and potential for challenge and growth.
