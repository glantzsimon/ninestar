    This combination can be <strong>one of the most magnetic</strong> and results in the most <strong>personal growth</strong>. There is often a lot of <strong>natural chemistry between people with opposite elements</strong>. It is also the combination that is <strong>most likely to lead to misunderstandings and conflict</strong>. Sometimes this combination <strong>can lead to the element that is being challenged feeling thwarted and stifled</strong>. This is particularly the case if the challenging element is in a more powerful position emotionally or energetically. However, as much as there can be greater conflict in this combination, it is in <strong>the resolution of this conflict that much progress is made</strong> and ultimately challenge leads to greater growth. It really comes down to the delicate balance between "carrot" and "stick".
