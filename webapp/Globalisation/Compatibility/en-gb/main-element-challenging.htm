    This combination can be <strong>one of the most magnetic</strong>, often sparking strong <strong>natural chemistry between people with opposing elements</strong>. It is also the dynamic that tends to bring about the greatest <strong>personal growth</strong>. However, it is also <strong>the most prone to misunderstandings and conflict</strong>. The energy being challenged may sometimes feel <strong>stifled or blocked</strong>, especially if the challenging energy holds more power—whether emotionally, energetically, or situationally.
