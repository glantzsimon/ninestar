<p>
    The Fundamental Energies have the same element. This combination tends to lead to a <strong>strong "sibling" relationship</strong> in which there is an <strong>effortless and profound understanding</strong> between both parties. There is a great potential for <strong>mutual understanding</strong>, <strong>compassion</strong> and <strong>harmony</strong> in the relationship as well as <strong>little antagonism or misunderstanding</strong>, although it can still happen, of course. However, this type of relationship typically <strong>does not result in very passionate romantic relationships</strong> as it may <strong>lack "spark" and chemistry</strong>. It can, however, lead to lifelong friendships and partnerships.
