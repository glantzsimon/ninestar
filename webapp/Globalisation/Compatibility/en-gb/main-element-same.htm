<p>
    In this combination, both people share the same Solar Element. This often creates a <strong>deep and effortless "sibling-like" bond</strong>, marked by a <strong>natural sense of understanding and harmony</strong>. There is strong potential for <strong>compassion</strong>, <strong>mutual support</strong> and <strong>emotional resonance</strong>, with relatively <strong>little conflict or misunderstanding</strong>—though disagreements can still occur from time to time.

    While this type of connection tends to feel easy and supportive, it may <strong>lack romantic intensity or chemistry</strong>. As such, it often leads to <strong>lasting friendships or solid partnerships</strong> rather than passionate love affairs.
