    The Fundamental Energies are in a Supportive Transformation, in which one Energy supports or nourishes the next. On the surface, it may appear that it is more of a one-way street. However, in reality, <strong>it does work both ways</strong>, even if the bulk of the support flows from the parent to the child. This is typically a very <strong>stable relationship</strong> and as the elements are not the same, there is <strong>generally more chemistry</strong> than in a sibling relationship, in which the elements are the same.

    Traditionally, in parts of China and Japan, <strong>families would consult 9 Star Ki astrologers when arranging marriages</strong> in order to ensure the <strong>maximum possible harmony and compatibility between the married couple</strong>. The Supportive Transformation was considered to be the most harmonious and favourable combination.
