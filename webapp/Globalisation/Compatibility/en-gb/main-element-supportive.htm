<p>
    In a Supportive Transformation, one Solar Energy naturally nourishes and sustains the next. At first glance, it may seem like a one-way dynamic, with most of the support flowing from the 'parent' to the 'child'. However, in practice, <strong>the exchange often goes both ways</strong>, creating a bond that feels both <strong>secure and mutually enriching</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    This is typically a <strong>very stable and harmonious relationship</strong>. And since the energies involved are not identical—as in sibling relationships—there is often <strong>more chemistry and personal growth potential</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    In traditional Chinese and Japanese culture, <strong>9 Star Ki astrologers were sometimes consulted when arranging marriages</strong> to ensure the highest level of compatibility. Among the most desirable matches was the Supportive Transformation, seen as <strong>the most harmonious and auspicious of all</strong>.
