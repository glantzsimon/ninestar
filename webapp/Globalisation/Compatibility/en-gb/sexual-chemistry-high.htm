    It is likely for the sexual chemistry to be pretty strong between these two individuals. Many of the elements, energetic "gender" (Yin / Yang) and modality are opposing one another, which typically results in quite a lot of magnetism and chemistry. At the same time, this combination is likely to bring a fair amount of disharmony and conflict. However, there are also a fair number of similarities and supportive elements, which increase the likelihood of harmony and healthy conflict resolution. Generally speaking, this type of connection is quite magnetic with good chemistry and could lead to an exciting romantic relationship with plenty of opportunity for personal growth.
