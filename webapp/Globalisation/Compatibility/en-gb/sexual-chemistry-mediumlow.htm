    The sexual chemistry is unlikely to be very strong between these two individuals, but it probably isn't insignificant either. There could well be quite a bit of passion to begin with; however, there is a risk that it could fizzle out if an effort isn't made to keep things alive and interesting. This has the potential to be quite a harmonious combination, but there are a few key differences, which give rise to some magnetism and chemsitry in the relationship, as well as to the potental for conflict. Generally speaking, this type of connection is better suited to friendship, however, there are exceptions to the rule.
