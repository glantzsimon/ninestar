    The sexual chemistry between these two individuals is likely to be <strong>relatively subtle</strong>. There may be an initial spark or sense of intrigue, but over time, <strong>the connection could lose momentum</strong> unless both partners make a conscious effort to keep the relationship engaging and emotionally connected. While this pairing may be <strong>better suited to companionship or friendship</strong>, there is still potential for a meaningful and lasting bond, especially if shared values and emotional intimacy are present.
