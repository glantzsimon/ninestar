    Off The Charts
</h5>
<p>
    The sexuality chemistry between these two individuals is potentially off the charts. The forces and elements governing this combination are all opposing one another, both between the Fundamental and Character Energies, creating an extremely strong magnetic attraction. This can be a truly explosive combination, but it could be too hot to handle! There is a very high risk of conflict and misunderstanding. This combination usually results in a roller-coaster ride. However, this type of relationship can also result in the most personal growth in the long run.
