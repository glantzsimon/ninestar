    It is likely for the sexual chemistry to be very strong between these two individuals. The elements, energetic "gender" (Yin / Yang) and modality are largely opposing one another, which typically results in significant magnetism and chemistry. At the same time, this combination is likely to bring a significant risk of disharmony and conflict as well as difficlulty in resolving it. Generally speaking, this type of connection is extremely magnetic with great chemistry and, whilst it could lead to a very exciting romantic relationship, it is also likely to result in a turbulent roller-coaster ride at times. With this combination comes a great opportunity for personal growth.
