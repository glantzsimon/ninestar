    Each of the 9 energies is associated with 1 of the 5 elements: Water, Tree, Fire, Earth and Metal, which corresponds to a specific point in the cycle
</h5>
<p>
    Each of the nine energies are associated with one of the five elements: Water, Tree, Fire, Earth and Metal. Each of the elements is associated with a season, a time of day, as well as a stage in the development from birth to death. A more accurate and helpful description is the 'five transformations', as in essence, <strong>each element represents a transformation from one 'state' of energy to the next</strong>.

<h5>
    The Earth element is often considered the transition between each of the stages
</h5>
<p>
    The Earth element is often considered a transitional point between the stages. For example, it describes the phase between seasons when the weather could easily revert to the previous season for a few days and then suddenly to the next in an unpredictable way.

<h5>
    The Earth element can also be placed between Fire and Metal, when discussing the 5 Transformations
</h5>
<p>
    However, for the purposes of understanding other aspects of 9 Star Ki (which we will discuss below), it is helpful to consider the element Earth as positioned between Fire and Metal, during the late summer, as seen in the following diagram:
