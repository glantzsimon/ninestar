<h5>
    The 5 transformations decribe how the 5 elements interact with one another
</h5>
<p>
    Each of the 5 elements relates to the other elements in 3 distinct ways, called "transformations". Traditional Chinese medicine use these same transformations to help make medical diagnoses, as well as to prescribe appropriate treatments to bring the body back into balance.
</p>

<h4>There are 3 different types of transformation or relationship:</h4>

<div id="same-transformation" style="position: relative; top: -180px;"></div>
<h5>Same Element (also known as the 'Sibling Relationship')</h5>

</div>
<p>
    In this instance, <strong>both energies share the same element</strong>. For example, it could be two 3 Tree energies or one 3 Tree and one 4 Tree Energy. This combination tends to lead to a <strong>strong "sibling" relationship</strong> with an <strong>effortless and profound understanding</strong> between both parties. There is a great potential for <strong>mutual understanding</strong>, <strong>compassion</strong> and <strong>harmony</strong> in the relationship as well as <strong>little antagonism or misunderstanding</strong>, although it can still happen, of course. However, this type of relationship typically <strong>does not result in very passionate romantic relationships</strong> as it may <strong>lack "spark" and chemistry</strong>. It can, however, lead to lifelong friendships and partnerships.

<div id="supportive-transformation" style="position: relative; top: -180px;"></div>
<h5>The Supportive Transformation (also known as the 'Cycle of Growth' or the 'Shen Cycle')</h5>
<div>
    <img title="Supportive Transformation" alt="Supportive Transformation" class="auto-size center-block" src="{BaseImagesPath}/ninestar/transformations/transformation-supportive.png" />
</div>
<p>
    In this instance, <strong>one of the energies supports and nourishes the next</strong>. For example, Tree energies support Fire energies. This is also known as the <strong>"Parent / Child" relationship</strong>. On the surface, it may appear that it is more of a one-way street. However, in reality, <strong>it does work both ways</strong>, even if the bulk of the support flows from the parent to the child. This is typically a very <strong>stable relationship</strong> and as the elements are not the same, there is <strong>generally more chemistry</strong> than in the previous transformation we discussed, in which the elements are the same.
</p>
<p>
    Traditionally, in parts of China and Japan, <strong>families would consult 9 Star Ki astrologers when arranging marriages</strong> in order to ensure the <strong>maximum possible harmony and compatibility between the married couple</strong>. The Supportive Transformation was considered to be the most harmonious and favourable combination.

<h5>The Challenging Transformation (also known as the 'Cycle of Destruction')</h5>

<p>
    This type of relationship can <strong>easily be misunderstood</strong>. There is nothing inherently bad about the challenging or 'antagonistic' transformation. In fact, it is an <strong>essential part of life</strong>. In Traditional Chinese medicine, which uses the elements to understand the organs and their relationship to one another and to one's overall health, it is said that the <strong>challenging element is vitally important in order to calm down an overactive one</strong> which it controls, in order to <strong>bring balance back to the body</strong>. For example, the water element is said to govern the kidneys. During accuate kidney failure, there is also a negative impact on the heart (Fire element), which is no longer brought into balance by the Water element, resulting in an increased risk of heart attack.
</p>

    This combination can be <strong>one of the most magnetic</strong> and results in the most <strong>personal growth</strong>. There is often a lot of <strong>natural chemistry between people with opposite elements</strong>. It is also the combination that is <strong>most likely to lead to misunderstandings and conflict</strong>. Sometimes this combination <strong>can lead to the element that is being challenged feeling thwarted and stifled</strong>. This is particularly the case if the challenging element is in a more powerful position emotionally or energetically. For example, a Tree person may feel as though all of their creativity - their "branches", so to speak - have been chopped down before they even had a chance to develop and explore any potential that may have been present. Or, a Fire person may feel their fire has been put out by a Water person, who wanted to do a deep dive into the depths of their terrain. However, as much as there can be greater conflict in this combination, it is in <strong>the resolution of this conflict that much progress is made</strong> and ultimately challenge leads to greater growth. It really comes down to the delicate balance between "carrot" and "stick".
