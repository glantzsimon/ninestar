<h5>The Adult Energy controls the Child Energy</h5>
<p>
    In this configuration, the adult energy tends to dominate and regulate the child energy, creating a strong sense of internal discipline. This often manifests as a high level of self-control, where the adult energy acts like an internalised authority or superego, observing and restraining the more spontaneous and emotionally reactive impulses of the child energy. While this can lead to maturity and responsibility from an early age, it may also suppress important aspects of emotional expression and the need for nurturing.

    People with this combination are often seen as “good children” due to their ability to self-regulate. They may be highly self-critical and generally more responsive to their own internal sense of right and wrong than to external correction. In fact, being disciplined by others may feel unnecessary or even insulting to them. Unless a parent shares the same adult or child energy, their efforts to guide or reprimand may have little impact.

    This strong internal authority can cause challenges later in life, particularly in relation to formal structures of power or authority. Depending on the context, the person may swing between complete compliance and outright rebellion. They may struggle with hierarchy, either following the rules too rigidly or rejecting them entirely in an effort to maintain their inner autonomy.
