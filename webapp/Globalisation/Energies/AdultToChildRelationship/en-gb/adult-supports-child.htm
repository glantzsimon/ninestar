<h5>The Adult Energy supports the Child Energy</h5>
<p>
    In this configuration, there is a natural sense of ease or compatibility between the adult and child energies, but with the adult energy now supporting the child. A person with this combination may initially operate from the strengths and clarity of their adult energy, but over time, the more reactive or emotional traits of the child energy can begin to emerge—especially in personal interactions.

    This may lead to moments of pushiness, emotional reactivity, or confusion, particularly in situations where the person once had more perspective or control. In such cases, a gentle but clear form of supportive confrontation—whether internal or external—is often helpful in bringing them back to balance. Fortunately, this dynamic rarely leads to deep or lasting conflict. With awareness, it can be relatively easy to restore harmony and reintegrate both energies in a healthy way.
