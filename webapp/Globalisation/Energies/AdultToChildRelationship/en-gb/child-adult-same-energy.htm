<h5>Adult and Child Energies Are the Same</h5>
<p>
    When both the adult and child energies are the same, there is no noticeable inner shift as the person transitions from childhood to adulthood. Life tends to feel continuous, as if the emotional tone and personality of the child simply extend into adult life. While this can bring a deep sense of consistency and familiarity, it can also result in a strong identification with one's own way of being, making it difficult to appreciate alternative perspectives.

    Physically, individuals with this configuration may be more prone to hypoglycaemia or energy regulation issues, and should take particular care with their diet, stress levels, and exposure to stimulants or psychoactive substances. Tailoring lifestyle choices to the specific needs of their elemental energy is especially important.
