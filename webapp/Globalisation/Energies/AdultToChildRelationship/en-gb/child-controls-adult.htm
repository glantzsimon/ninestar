<h5>The Child Energy controls the Adult Energy</h5>
<p>
    In this configuration, the adult energy is frequently overpowered by unresolved patterns and emotional needs from childhood. The person may find it difficult to fully express their mature potential, as their adult responses are frequently challenged or undermined by inner emotional habits. This can result in a lack of follow-through, avoidance of responsibility, or a tendency to procrastinate—especially when faced with challenging or unfamiliar situations.
</p>
<p>
    Rather than approaching life from a place of clarity and purpose, the person may fall back on familiar emotional coping strategies from early life. This can include self-sabotage, manipulation, or excessive dependency on others for support or validation. Assertiveness and independence are often compromised, and there may be a tendency to blame others or external circumstances for their difficulties.
</p>
<p>
    In such cases, it can be helpful to explore and consciously meet the unmet emotional needs represented by the child energy. By nurturing these deeper aspects of the self with care and understanding, the adult energy is no longer held hostage by the past and can begin to express itself with greater clarity, maturity, and freedom.
