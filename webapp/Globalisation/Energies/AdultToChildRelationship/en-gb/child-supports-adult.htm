<h5>The Child Energy supports the Adult Energy</h5>
<p>
    In this configuration, there tends to be a smooth and supportive transition from childhood into adulthood. The child energy, positioned as the “mother” in the mother–child relationship described in Five Element theory, naturally nourishes and uplifts the adult energy. As a result, the individual is less likely to experience deep conflict or trauma in adapting to life’s challenges.

    Even in adulthood, the qualities of the child energy continue to enhance and enrich the adult expression, rather than undermine it. Difficulties or stress associated with the child number are more easily absorbed and transformed, and the lessons that arise from them are often integrated with greater ease and maturity than in other energy combinations.
