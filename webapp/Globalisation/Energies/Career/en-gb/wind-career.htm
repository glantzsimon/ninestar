    4 Tree Energies are excellent planners and organisers and often do extremely well at activities and jobs that require such skills.
    On the other hand, being naturally adaptable and sensitive to others, they can also do very well at public relations. 
    Wind Energies would also suit broadcasting, television or cinema where they could exploit their sensitivity to the arts.
