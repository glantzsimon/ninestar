    Wind Children — Creative Spirits, Sensitive Dreamers
</h5>
<p>
    4 Tree children are imaginative, expressive, and full of creative promise. Like a spring breeze, their energy is fluid and changeable—blowing in new directions as inspiration strikes. They often show early signs of talent in music, writing, performance, or other creative forms of communication. These children flourish when given encouragement, emotional warmth, and a sense of spaciousness in which to explore their inner worlds. They need inspiration just as much as structure, and thrive in environments where their ideas are not only accepted, but celebrated.

    One of the greatest gifts a caregiver can give a Wind child is belief in their vision. Their dreams may seem grand or unconventional, but they are often fueled by an inner knowing that should not be dismissed. Criticism, ridicule, or emotional coldness—especially when directed at their creative expression—can be deeply wounding and may cause them to retreat or lose confidence. These children benefit immensely from regular encouragement and visible appreciation for their efforts, even when the results are still taking form.

    At times, 4 Tree children can be inconsistent, forgetful, or overly trusting. They may move quickly from one interest to another or become swept up in relationships or fantasies that lack grounding. A gentle, loving reminder of their commitments—without shame or rigidity—can help them stay connected to what matters most. With nurturing support, they grow into inspired, empathetic, and expressive individuals who carry the ability to move others with their words, ideas, and presence.
