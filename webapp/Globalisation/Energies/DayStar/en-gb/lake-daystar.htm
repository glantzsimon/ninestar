    7 Metal children are naturally fun-loving and it is very important for them to have plenty of social interaction. 7 Lake children's naturally gregarious and outgoing character could easily be damanged if they spend too much time alone in their formative years and could lead to their being withdrawn, aloof and introverted later on in life.

    Lake children are quite independent and free-spirited and this should be encouraged by allowing them greater freedom.

    However, care must be taken not to overindulge these children either. Doing so could be exceptionally detrimental to their development and they could easily end up being spoilt, demanding and overbearing.
