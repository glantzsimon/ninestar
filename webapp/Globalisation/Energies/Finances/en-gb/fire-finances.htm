    Fire Energies tend to have a <strong>magnetic relationship with money</strong>—they know how to attract it and are often skilled at making it through their charisma, creativity, or entrepreneurial flair. Their ability to inspire and communicate makes them excellent at <strong>sales, promotion, or client-facing work</strong> where money naturally follows their influence.

    However, they are also known for being <strong>impulsive spenders</strong>. Drawn to beauty, luxury, and high-quality experiences, Fire Energies often indulge in the finer things in life—stylish clothing, elegant homes, fine dining, or artistic indulgences. Their <strong>expensive taste and love of pleasure</strong> can lead them to spend as quickly as they earn.

    They are typically <strong>generous to a fault</strong>, often treating friends, family, or even strangers with open-hearted abundance. This generosity, while noble, can also leave them vulnerable to overextending themselves or <strong>neglecting their long-term financial security</strong>.

    To thrive financially, Fire Energies benefit from <strong>supportive structures or advisors</strong> who can help them manage the details, track spending, and keep their long-term goals in focus. When balanced, they can live a life of <strong>abundant prosperity, radiant generosity, and artistic beauty</strong>.
