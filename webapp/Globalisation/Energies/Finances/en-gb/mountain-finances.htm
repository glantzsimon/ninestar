<h4>Finances and Resource Management</h4>
<p>
    Mountain energies tend to be fortunate when it comes to finances. Whether through <strong>steady effort, long-term investments, or family legacies</strong>, they often accumulate wealth gradually—and sometimes significantly—over the course of their lives. Many 8 Earth individuals benefit from an inheritance or other material support that adds to their natural ability to build and preserve wealth.

<p>
    They have a <strong>good instinct for investments</strong> and are often drawn to property, land, or stable ventures that promise security over flashy returns. Their financial growth tends to be methodical and grounded in practical choices, often reflecting their personal values of self-sufficiency and discipline.

<p>
    By nature, Mountains are <strong>economical, resourceful, and pragmatic</strong>. They are not prone to wastefulness and usually manage their money with care. However, when unbalanced, this strength can become a weakness—manifesting as thriftiness, materialism, or a tendency to hoard rather than circulate wealth.

<p>
    At their best, 8 Earth individuals are excellent long-term stewards of money. They value what they have, often use it to support others, and build strong foundations for future generations. Financially, they are often the stable "mountain" others rely on.
