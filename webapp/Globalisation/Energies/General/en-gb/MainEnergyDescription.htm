    Constitution — Our Core Energy & Energetic Foundation
</h5>
<p>
    The Core Energy represents our <strong>constitution</strong>—the energetic foundation of our adult self. Sometimes referred to as the Main Energy or Principal Ki, it begins to express more fully around the age of 18, after we’ve completed two full nine-year cycles. From that point onward, it becomes the dominant influence in our lives, shaping our worldview, decisions, and identity.
</p>
<p>
    It has a powerful effect on the way we <strong>think, process information, and engage with the world around us</strong>. It forms the basis of how we approach life—our natural rhythm, the pace we operate at, how we learn, and how we communicate our ideas. It also strongly informs our <strong>values, temperament, and the way we interact with others</strong>, especially in adult relationships, careers, and social roles.
</p>
<p>
    Physically, the Main Energy also governs the <strong>overall flow of Ki through the body</strong>. It influences the health of our organs, the strength of our constitution, and the way we respond to energetic imbalances or environmental stress. In Traditional Chinese Medicine and Macrobiotics, a person’s 9 Star Ki chart—especially this number—is sometimes consulted to guide treatment, nutrition, and lifestyle choices.
</p>
<p>
    Because it serves as the "anchor" in the chart, this number can also help us understand the deeper lessons and personal themes we are here to explore in this lifetime. When we work in harmony with this Energy, we tend to feel balanced, capable, and aligned with our purpose. When we act against its nature, we may feel blocked, misunderstood, or exhausted.
</p>
<p>
    In many ways, the Main Energy is our energetic fingerprint. It reflects both the gifts we bring into the world and the challenges we are here to grow through.
