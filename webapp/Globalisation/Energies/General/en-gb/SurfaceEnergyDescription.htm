    Social Expression — Our Public Face & Social Behaviours
</h5>
<p>
    This Energy describes <strong>how we appear to others</strong>, especially upon <strong>first impression</strong>. It shapes the way we present ourselves in social settings—our body language, tone of voice, and overall style of communication. While it may not always reflect our deeper inner world, it plays a strong role in our <strong>social behaviour, public interactions, and the way we navigate everyday life</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    The Surface Energy also influences our <strong>thinking patterns and perception</strong>—how we take in information from our surroundings and how we express ourselves outwardly. In casual or unfamiliar environments, this number often becomes the most visible part of our personality. It’s the version of ourselves that colleagues, acquaintances, and strangers are most likely to encounter.
</p>
<p>
    While its influence is generally more subtle than the Lunar or Solar Energies, it still contributes meaningfully to our overall temperament. It can also act as a kind of social “filter” that shapes how others receive us—and sometimes, how we attempt to shape their perception of us.
