    Please note that the 'Emotional Ki' or 'Lunar Ki' alone does not give a very detailed description of a person. It is important to also take into account the 'Solar Ki' or 'Fundamental Adult Nature', as well as the 'Social Expression'. However, it does give a useful overview of their deeper character. The Emotional Ki also has quite a significant influence on intimate relationships, where the more emotional aspects of ourselves tend to be revealed.
