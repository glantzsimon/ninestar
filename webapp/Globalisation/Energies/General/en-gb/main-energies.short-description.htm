<h5>
    The Solar Energy description alone only describes one aspect of the chart.

<p>
    Please note that the 'Solar Energy' alone does not give a very granular description of a person. The 'Emotional Ki', as well as the 'Mirror Ki' play a significant role in shaping a person's character traits. However, the Solar Energy does give a very useful overview. Also, of the three components of a personal chart, the Solar Energy has the most significant influence on a person's nature and is especially useful when trying to determine the kind of dynamic that is likely to exist between two people.
