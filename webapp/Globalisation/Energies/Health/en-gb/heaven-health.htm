<h4>Health and Wellness</h4>
<p>
    Heaven energies are typically blessed with a strong constitution and considerable physical endurance. However, as representatives of the Yang Metal element, they must take particular care of the lungs, which are their most vulnerable organ. Maintaining lung health is critical to their overall wellbeing, making it essential to avoid smoking and environmental pollutants, and to engage in regular cardiovascular activity that supports healthy respiration.

<p>
    In Chinese Medicine, the lungs are considered the seat of grief. For 6 Metal individuals, unexpressed sorrow or emotional suppression can directly impact their respiratory and immune systems. It is especially important for them to “get things off their chest”—to speak openly, release grief, and create space for emotional clarity and breath. Holding emotions in can lead to energetic stagnation and physical symptoms over time.

    The lungs are also energetically linked to the skin. For this reason, Heaven energies are more prone to conditions like asthma, eczema, psoriasis, or skin rashes—especially when emotional tension builds or the system becomes overwhelmed. Regular detoxification through sweat, breathwork, or lymphatic movement can help release stored tension and keep the skin and lungs healthy.

    Metal’s associated season is autumn, a time of inward turning and letting go. For 6 Metal individuals, this season is particularly potent for reflection, refinement, and emotional release. It’s a natural time to take stock of one’s life and to realign with deeper values and direction.

    While naturally strong and capable, 6 Metal individuals must also be mindful not to overextend themselves mentally or physically. Overwork, perfectionism, or the tendency to "carry on" through emotional pain can lead to migraines, tension, posture issues, and chronic fatigue. The remedy lies in moderation, movement, and mindful release.

<p>
    Practices such as yoga, breathwork, group meditation, and structured physical activity help Heaven energies remain grounded, clear, and vital. These practices provide an outlet for their inner intensity and help them stay attuned to both body and emotion, which is essential for long-term balance and resilience.
