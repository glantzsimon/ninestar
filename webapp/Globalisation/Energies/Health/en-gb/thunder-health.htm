<h4>Health and Physical Wellbeing</h4>
<p>
    The Tree element governs the liver and gallbladder—organs vital to detoxification and the smooth flow of energy throughout the body. For those born under the influence of Thunder Energy, nurturing these organs is especially important for maintaining balance, vitality, and emotional clarity.
</p>

<p>
    Thunder Energies are highly sensitive and energetic by nature. As such, they benefit greatly from dietary and lifestyle habits that promote internal harmony. Eating should be done mindfully, with care taken to avoid overeating and refraining from food intake two to three hours before sleep. This allows the liver its much-needed time to regenerate and replenish during the night.
</p>

<p>
    Late nights and nocturnal routines can disturb this vital repair process. The liver's regenerative cycle is most active during sleep, making proper rest essential. Thunder Energies should prioritize consistent, restorative sleep to support liver health and emotional stability.
</p>

<p>
    A diet rich in green leafy vegetables is especially supportive, along with citrus fruits like lemons, limes, and grapefruits. Apple cider vinegar, taken regularly, can also aid in liver and gallbladder cleansing. Natural supplements such as milk thistle, dandelion root, and calcium d-glucarate offer additional support, while occasional coffee enemas may assist detoxification for those inclined.

<h4>Balancing Movement and Stillness</h4>
<p>
    Three-Tree individuals are perhaps the most agile of all the Nine Star Ki numbers. Their bodies express a delicate interplay between muscular precision and a finely tuned nervous system, granting them speed, grace, and adaptability. However, this refined sensitivity also means they are particularly susceptible to imbalances.
</p>

<p>
    Maintaining a healthy level of physical activity is essential, but so too is cultivating deep rest and relaxation. Both over-exertion and under-exertion can disrupt the nervous system, leading to issues such as sprains, connective tissue strain, joint problems, or even nerve-related concerns like paralysis. Stretching practices, isometric exercises, and disciplines that promote balance—such as yoga—are especially beneficial.
</p>

<p>
    As with their physical nature, Thunder Energies must also balance the mental and emotional realms. Their quick and active minds are prone to anxiety, overwhelm, and mental tension under stress. Left unaddressed, this can give rise to frustration or repressed anger. Therefore, regular grounding practices, along with meditation, breathwork, and autogenic training, are not just beneficial—they are essential.
</p>

<h4>Diet and Lifestyle Recommendations</h4>
<p>
    To keep the liver and gallbladder light and free-flowing, Thunder Energies should avoid foods high in fats, oils, refined flours, dairy products, and alcohol. Psychoactive substances, including prescription medications and recreational drugs, should be approached with caution. Smoking—particularly tobacco or marijuana—is strongly discouraged.
</p>

<p>
    A plant-forward diet, light on animal products and rich in complex carbohydrates, fruits, and especially green vegetables, is ideal. Thunder Energies should also be mindful of external influences, such as the wind—particularly easterly breezes—which can disturb their finely attuned systems. Dressing appropriately and protecting oneself from the elements supports both physical and energetic wellbeing.
