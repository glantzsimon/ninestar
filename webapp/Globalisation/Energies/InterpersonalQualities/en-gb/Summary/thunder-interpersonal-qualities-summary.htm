<h4>Communication and Expression</h4>
<p>
    Thunder energies are <strong>frank and expressive communicators</strong>. They tend to <strong>speak their minds with little filter</strong>, sometimes unintentionally offending others. However, their <strong>warmth, charm, and humor</strong> help soften their directness. Their bold expressiveness is both a strength and a learning edge, requiring them to be mindful of how their words affect others.
