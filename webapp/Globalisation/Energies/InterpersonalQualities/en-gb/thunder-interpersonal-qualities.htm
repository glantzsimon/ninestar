    However, this openness can sometimes become too raw or intense, especially when they are unbalanced. When they feel overstimulated or under pressure, they may become <strong>impatient, rash, undiplomatic, or overly blunt</strong>. This directness, while well-intentioned, can occasionally cause friction with those who prefer a more subtle approach. Additionally, they may display <strong>explosive emotions, irritability, or aggressive tendencies</strong> that can overwhelm more sensitive individuals. When their energy is too strong, they can come across as domineering, especially when they become <strong>opinionated, hyperactive, or unfiltered in their expressions</strong>.

<h4>Communication and Expression</h4>
<p>
    Thunder energies are known for being <strong>frank and expressive communicators</strong>. They are not ones to shy away from sharing their thoughts, often <strong>saying what’s on their mind with little filter</strong>. This directness can sometimes unintentionally offend others, particularly those who are more reserved or sensitive. However, Thunder energies are usually able to smooth things over with their <strong>warmth, charm, and humor</strong>, which tend to soften the impact of their bluntness. Their ability to express themselves openly is both a strength and a potential learning edge. While their boldness in communication can make them great leaders or catalysts, it is important for them to be mindful of how their words affect others, especially when they are feeling more energetic or charged.
