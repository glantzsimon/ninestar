    However, they may also struggle with <strong>restlessness or emotional self-centeredness</strong>. If they feel unappreciated or criticized, they may retreat emotionally or even lose confidence.

    Fires can be <strong>deeply romantic but also somewhat idealistic</strong> in love.

    Ultimately, Fire energies thrive in relationships that offer <strong>both admiration and emotional resonance</strong>.
