<h4>3 Tree / Thunder Women and Relationships</h4>

<p>
    A 3 Tree woman seeks a relationship where she can be deeply engaged yet retain her sense of autonomy. Her fiery passions and intense nature often lead her to have multiple love affairs, but she tends to marry at a relatively young age. If she does not, it is likely due to the many ambitions that drive her. When in a relationship with a 3 Tree woman, her partner must recognize that her intensity may extend beyond romantic relationships into other passions and endeavors, though not necessarily with other partners.

<p>
    Her physical appearance is of great significance, as is that of her partner. 3 Tree women are often sensitive about their looks, and may feel a sense of competition with other women. For them, physicality and touch are central to their emotional and sexual well-being. When deprived of affection, they can feel emotionally starved. However, their profound intensity often leads them to suppress their own sexual and emotional needs, which can result in emotional and physical strain. They may experience a sense of emotional distance or, at times, even become aloof or aggressive in response to these pent-up passions. The struggle to balance their intense desires with the realities of everyday life can lead to fluctuating dynamics within the relationship, sometimes causing periods of dramatic change.
</p>
<p>
    At her core, the 3 Tree woman thrives when she is free to express her playful, free-spirited nature. When her partner is able to embrace her dynamism and grant her the space she requires, they will discover a deeply sensitive and loving individual beneath the surface of motion and energy. She is vibrant, exciting, and full of life when allowed to fully engage her energy.
