<h5>
    Strong ideals and expectations may delay the formation of lasting partnerships

Because of this, they may struggle to empathise with {PotentialMatesText} who don’t meet their expectations or emotional tone. They may not quickly notice when relationships begin to break down, often staying in unsatisfying or dysfunctional relationships longer than is healthy. When not in a relationship, they may remain aloof or detached, waiting for the ideal partner rather than compromising.
