<h4>
    Both Solar and Lunar Energies Are Yang and Therefore Aligned With Gender
</h4>

<h5>
    A powerful combination that tends to result in a confident expression and understanding of one's sexuality
</h5>
<p>
    As both the Lunar and Solar Energies are in line with gender, men with this combination tend to feel naturally comfortable with their masculine identity and expression. This often gives rise to confidence in self-presentation and an ease in both platonic and romantic relationships. Their sexual energy is strong and steady, and they rarely experience internal conflict regarding self-expression.
</p>

<h5>
    Men with this combination may have a somewhat idealistic view of relationships, leading to it taking longer to find a mate
</h5>
<p>
    Strongly influenced by their own masculine energetics, these men often hold high ideals about love and partnership. As a result, they may have difficulty empathising fully with the opposite sex, and their expectations in relationships may be coloured by how they themselves would think, feel, or behave. This can lead to disappointment if a partner does not reflect those expectations. They may hold on to relationships that are no longer healthy, hoping for alignment that never quite materialises.
</p>

<h5>
    Men with this combination are prepared to wait for the "right one", which can lead to longer periods of celibacy
</h5>
<p>
    Their inner stability and sexual confidence often allow these men to remain celibate for extended periods without distress. They are more inclined to wait for the right partner than to settle for temporary satisfaction. During such times, they may focus on personal growth or explore sexuality in a playful, light-hearted way without emotional entanglement. Some may even adapt easily to a monastic or solitary lifestyle if the conditions call for it.

<h5>
    Men with this combination usually feel comfortable with {PotentialMatesText}, but they may not fully understand them
</h5>
<p>
    Men with this dual-Yang alignment often relate well to both genders and can form easy, natural friendships with {PotentialMatesText}. However, as they lack the complementary Yin element in their energetic makeup, some emotional or behavioural aspects of their potential partners may remain elusive. While they may appear confident and connected, they sometimes miss subtle cues or fail to notice when a relationship is beginning to deteriorate.

<h5>
    Strong sexual vitality and robust reproductive health
</h5>
<p>
    From a physical standpoint, men with this configuration rarely experience issues related to their reproductive system. Their sexual energy is typically strong and well-regulated, contributing to a robust sense of personal power and resilience.
