<h4>
    Solar Energy is Yang and opposite to gender. Emotional Ki is Yin and in line with gender

<h5>
    These women may feel confident in youth, but experience deeper insecurity later on
</h5>
<p>
    In childhood and adolescence, the Emotional Ki is dominant and, in this configuration, is in line with gender. This tends to make women with this combination feel confident in their femininity early in life. They often relate easily and playfully with {SexualPartnersText}, and may express themselves in ways that reflect traditional female qualities with ease.

<p>
    However, as they reach adulthood and the Solar Energy becomes more influential, its Yang (masculine) and opposite-gender nature may bring a degree of internal conflict. This shift can create confusion or insecurity about their role in romantic or sexual relationships. Some may feel misunderstood or disconnected from {PotentialMatesText}, despite earlier ease in such dynamics.

<h5>
    Tension between expression and inner experience may result in relational challenges
</h5>
<p>
    Outwardly, these women may express confidence and embody stereotypical feminine traits—through appearance, tone, or mannerisms—but may simultaneously feel uncertain or emotionally vulnerable inside. This duality can sometimes make it hard for them to form deep romantic connections, even though they long for them. Their seeming bravado or strength may mask an inner desire for validation or understanding.

<h5>
    A strong understanding of others, but difficulty applying it to the self
</h5>
<p>
    One of the strengths of this configuration is the ability to see both perspectives—masculine and feminine—with clarity and insight. These women often excel at offering advice, support, and understanding to others, especially in emotional or relational matters. However, they may struggle to apply that same wisdom to their own relationships. When under stress, they can fall back on stereotypes or social conditioning, rather than their deeper emotional truth.
