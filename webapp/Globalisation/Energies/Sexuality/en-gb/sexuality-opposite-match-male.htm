<h4>
    Core Energy is Yin and opposite to gender. Emotional Ki is Yang and in line with gender

<h5>
    Confidence in youth, followed by inner conflict in adulthood
</h5>
<p>
    During adolescence, the Emotional Ki is the dominant influence, and in this case, it aligns with gender. This often results in boys with this combination expressing themselves with confidence and ease in social and romantic situations. They may be charismatic, self-assured, and comfortable around {SexualPartnersText}, often feeling non-threatened and even popular in early life. However, as they transition into adulthood and the influence of the Core Energy grows stronger, inner doubts may begin to surface. The Core Energy is opposite to gender and may bring about subtle discomfort or insecurity around their sexuality and gender identity.

<h5>
    Masculine expression may be exaggerated, masking inner tension
</h5>
<p>
    Men with this configuration often express strong outward masculinity, emphasising stereotypical traits through dress, body language, or social roles. This may come across as confidence, but it can also be a way to mask an internal insecurity. When this surface expression is challenged—especially in emotionally vulnerable or intimate settings—they may encounter feelings of self-doubt or confusion about how to authentically connect with {PotentialMatesText}.

<h5>
    Difficulty in relationships may stem from internal conflict
</h5>
<p>
    These men often long for deep, meaningful relationships, yet struggle to form them—not because of a lack of interest or emotional capacity, but due to unresolved inner tension. When relationships don’t meet their expectations, they may unconsciously blame external circumstances or the perceived inadequacies of others, rather than acknowledging the insecurity or self-protection that may be getting in the way. The bravado they display can sometimes act as a barrier to deeper connection.

<h5>
    Gifted with insight into others’ emotional dynamics
</h5>
<p>
    Despite these challenges, this combination often brings with it a sharp, intuitive understanding of other people’s emotional and relational patterns. Because they carry both gender polarities within their chart, these men can be remarkably insightful and are often valued as thoughtful listeners or advisors. However, applying that same clarity to their own lives can be more difficult, particularly when their own emotions feel overwhelming or at odds with their outward persona.
