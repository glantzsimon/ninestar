<h5>Stress and the 6 Metal Child</h5>
<p>
    In times of stress, a person with a 6 Metal child energy may find themselves falling back into patterns of emotional detachment, perfectionism, or harsh self-discipline or criticism. As children, they may have felt the need to be strong, capable, or beyond reproach—often suppressing vulnerability to meet expectations. Under pressure, the adult may become overly rigid, critical, or distant, struggling to access softer emotions or to let go of control.

    This internal tension impacts the Metal-related systems: the lungs, large intestine, skin, and pineal gland. Stress may manifest as shallow breathing, respiratory weakness, skin conditions, or digestive stagnation—especially difficulty letting go, both physically and emotionally. Healing involves softening the inner edge, allowing grief or tenderness to surface, and reconnecting with the breath as a gateway to emotional release and inner clarity.
