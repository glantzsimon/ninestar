<h5>Stress and the 7 Metal Child</h5>
<p>
    When a person with a 7 Metal child energy feels stressed, it can trigger old patterns of emotional masking, avoidance, or seeking comfort through distraction and pleasure. In childhood, this energy often learned to charm or entertain as a way to keep things light and avoid deeper emotional discomfort. Under stress, the adult may become overly talkative or withdrawn, using surface-level ease to cover a sense of inner disconnection or sadness.

    This emotional pattern tends to affect the Metal-related systems: lungs, large intestine, skin, and the speech anatomy. Stress may show up as respiratory sensitivity, tension in the jaw or mouth, digestive irregularity, or skin breakouts. There can also be a sense of emotional numbness or feeling unseen. Healing begins with quiet honesty—creating space to feel what's beneath the smile and allowing true connection to replace the need for performance.
