<h5>Stress and The 3 Tree Inner Child</h5>
<p>
    Under stress, those with a 3 Tree inner child energy may experience a resurgence of early emotional patterns related to frustration, impatience, or feeling unheard. As children, they may have struggled with boundaries, emotional outbursts, or needing to push forward before they were ready. In adult life, stress can reignite these dynamics—leading to irritability, restlessness, or a compulsive need to act, even when stillness or reflection might be more helpful.

    This tension often expresses itself through the liver, muscles, connective tissue, and feet—the Tree-related systems of the body. Stress may manifest as tight shoulders, muscle cramps, fatigue in the legs, or inflammation in the joints and tendons. There can also be a feeling of being emotionally "jammed," unable to find a clear outlet for inner tension. Healing begins by gently slowing down, grounding excess energy, and making space to express feelings in creative and constructive ways.
