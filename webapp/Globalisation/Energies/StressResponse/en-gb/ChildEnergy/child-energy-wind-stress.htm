<h5>Stress and the 4 Tree Child</h5>
<p>
    For someone with a 4 Tree child energy, stress can stir up old patterns of anxiety, overthinking, or emotional entanglement. In childhood, this energy may have learned to adapt by anticipating others' needs, navigating unspoken tensions, or constantly adjusting to maintain harmony. When stressed, these habits can return as nervous energy, indecision, or a tendency to lose one's center in the swirl of external demands and inner dialogue.

    This emotional unrest affects the Wind-related systems: the nervous system, diaphragm, and gallbladder. Symptoms might include shallow breathing, tension around the solar plexus, digestive discomfort from nervousness, or sleep disturbances. Mentally, it can feel like being blown in too many directions at once. Healing involves returning to the breath, quieting the mental noise, and gently reclaiming a sense of internal direction and calm authority.
