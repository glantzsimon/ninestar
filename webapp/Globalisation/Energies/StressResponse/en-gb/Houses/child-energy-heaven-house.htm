    When the Child Energy was in the 6 Metal House at the time of birth, the stress response is often characterised by a strong desire to regain control, maintain order, or “hold it all together.” These individuals tend to internalise pressure by becoming overly disciplined, emotionally distant, or hypercritical—especially toward themselves. Their natural strength and clarity may harden into perfectionism, rigidity, or harsh judgment under stress. Rather than showing vulnerability, they may double down on structure or retreat into silence, appearing cold or detached even when they are hurting deeply inside.

    There is often a great deal of pride in this energetic profile, which can make it difficult for them to ask for help or admit when they are struggling. Instead, they may isolate, mask their feelings with logic, or try to out-think the problem. Over time, this suppression can lead to feelings of loneliness, exhaustion, or emotional numbness. The key to soothing Metal stress is not to push harder, but to soften. Gentle connection, honest conversation, and safe emotional spaces help them open up and release inner tension. Creative expression, breathwork, or spending time in beautiful, peaceful surroundings can help them reconnect with a sense of inner spaciousness and grace.
