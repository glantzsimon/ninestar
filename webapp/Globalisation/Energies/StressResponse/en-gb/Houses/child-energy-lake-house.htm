<h5>Child Energy was in the 7 Metal House at the time of birth</h5>

    When the Child Energy was in the 7 Metal House at the time of birth, stress tends to manifest through emotional withdrawal, moodiness, or a retreat into distractions. These individuals often try to maintain a light-hearted, sociable exterior, but under stress, that surface charm may give way to inner sadness, melancholy, or passive resistance. Rather than expressing their discomfort directly, they may become aloof, sarcastic, or evasive—sometimes masking their true feelings with humour or diversion. There can be a tendency to internalise pain while appearing cheerful on the outside.

    If their environment feels tense or emotionally overwhelming, they may disconnect to preserve a sense of inner calm. But this detachment can lead to feelings of disconnection, loneliness, or unacknowledged grief. The Lake nature is reflective, and when the waters are disturbed, clarity is lost. These individuals benefit from gentle emotional processing—journaling, artistic expression, or quiet time in serene surroundings. What helps most is being met with kindness and emotional sincerity, allowing them to soften and share what's really going on beneath the surface. Pleasure, music, and connection to beauty can also help restore emotional flow.
