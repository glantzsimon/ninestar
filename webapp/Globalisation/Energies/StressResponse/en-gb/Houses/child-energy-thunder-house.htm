    When the Child Energy was in the 3 Tree House at the time of birth, stress tends to provoke a quick, expressive, and sometimes chaotic reaction. This is not a withdrawn or passive response—on the contrary, these individuals are more likely to speak loudly, act impulsively, or lash out in frustration. There may be a surge of energy that needs immediate release, often through talking, movement, or creative expression. Their minds race, and their emotions rise quickly to the surface. If there is no healthy outlet, this energy can become volatile, leading to outbursts, irritability, or recklessness.

    Thunder stress responses often carry a sense of urgency—feeling like something must be resolved now or that action must be taken immediately. Patience is difficult under stress, and they may become reactive, scattered, or prone to making rash decisions. At a deeper level, this impulsivity is often a mask for insecurity or vulnerability that they’re not ready to face. Grounding practices, structured movement (like dance, martial arts, or fast walking), and calming breathwork can help discharge excess energy. These individuals benefit greatly from being heard and validated in the moment, which helps restore emotional clarity and direction.
