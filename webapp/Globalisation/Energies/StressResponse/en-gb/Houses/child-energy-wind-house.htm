    When the Child Energy was in the 4 Tree House at the time of birth, stress often triggers feelings of restlessness, emotional instability, and uncertainty. This is a highly sensitive and changeable energy, and when overwhelmed, the person may appear scattered, indecisive, or mentally overstimulated. Their thoughts may race in circles, and they may struggle to settle on a clear course of action. The tendency is to overthink, overtalk, or reach out to too many people for advice—yet still feel unsure. Emotional confusion, anxiety, and a need for reassurance are common under pressure.

    Wind energy becomes unpredictable when destabilised—it can swing from cheerful to despondent, focused to distracted, open to avoidant, all within a short span of time. These individuals may become more socially dependent when stressed, craving connection but not always knowing who to trust. Conversely, they may also become overly guarded or easily influenced by those around them. To regain stability, they benefit from gentle structure, grounding routines, and calming rituals. Time in nature, slow movement, and supportive conversation help them reconnect to their inner clarity. What they need most is calm reassurance, gentle encouragement, and a safe space to pause and reset.
