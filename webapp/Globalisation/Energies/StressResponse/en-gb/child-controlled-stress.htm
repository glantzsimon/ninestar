<h4>Internal Restriction</h4>
<p>
    When a person’s character number is controlled by that of the house it occupies at birth, they may experience stress as a kind of invisible restraint. Rather than acting out, they often internalize this dynamic, leading to resignation or a quiet sense of defeat—“This is just how things are.” However, unlike the passive complacency seen in other configurations, this pattern carries a subtle but potent undercurrent of frustration. These individuals may yearn for freedom but feel trapped by perceived limitations. Under stress, they don’t need pushing—they need encouragement. Support and belief in their potential can help them break through deeply rooted feelings of futility and reclaim a sense of agency.
