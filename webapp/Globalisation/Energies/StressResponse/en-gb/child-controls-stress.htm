<h4>Inner Power Struggle</h4>
<p>
    When a person’s character energy controls the energy of the house it occupies at birth, a surprising reversal can occur under stress. Instead of feeling empowered, they may feel stifled—like a leader whose influence is blocked by the very system they’re meant to guide. This inner tension often surfaces as emotional volatility, especially during moments of pressure. The individual may react suddenly or intensely, not because of the situation itself, but due to deeper psychological frustration stemming from a sense of inner confinement. Rebelliousness, defiance, or abrupt behavior may mask an underlying desire to reclaim agency. Recognizing this dynamic helps reduce misplaced blame and opens the door to greater self-awareness and emotional regulation.
