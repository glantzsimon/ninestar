<h4>Stuck in the Parent’s House</h4>
<p>
    When a person’s character number is placed in the house of its “parent” energy, there can be a deep-seated reliance on familiar patterns and support structures. Under stress, this often manifests as emotional inertia—a sense of resignation or passive discontent. The person may feel stuck, aware that things aren’t ideal, yet unable or unwilling to take meaningful action. They may express frustration or dissatisfaction, but without the inner drive to initiate change. Others might feel compelled to challenge them, sensing the untapped potential beneath their complacency. This configuration can blur the line between comfort and confinement, making it hard for the person to envision a life beyond what they’ve always known.
