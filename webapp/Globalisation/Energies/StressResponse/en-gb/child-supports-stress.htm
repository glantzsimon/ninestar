<h4>The Critical Caregiver</h4>
<p>
    When a person’s character number holds a “mothering” relationship to the house it occupies at birth, they often respond to stress with heightened vigilance and a strong desire to manage or control their environment. Like a concerned parent checking in on a child, they may feel compelled to improve what they see, leading to critical or overly opinionated behavior—both toward themselves and others. Under pressure, they tend to fixate on what’s not working, and their emotional responses—whether joy or disappointment—can swing to extremes. Recognizing this pattern can help them temper their expectations and find more balance in how they relate to challenges.
