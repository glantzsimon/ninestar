</h4>

<p>
    Greetings and thank you for visiting NineStar. Whether you are new to 9 Star Ki or even new to astrology as a whole, you've come to a great resource to find detailed and accurate information on this ancient and fascinating system of astrology.
</p>

<h5>
    Possibly the oldest system of astrology in the world
</h5>

<p>
    9 Star Ki is based off the 4000-year-old Chinese 'Book of Changes' (the 'I Ching'), whose principles are the foundations of Feng Shui, traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture. It is a simple system offering <strong>profound insights into ourselves and our relationships with others</strong> and is a truly exceptional tool to <strong>help resolve conflict</strong> in a way that minimises blame and <strong>maximises understanding and compassion</strong>.
</p>

<h5>
    9 Star Ki is uncannily accurate
</h5>
<p>
    Despite individual upbringings, cultural differences and genetics, 9 Star Ki is remarkably precise. Of course, it is natural to find some of the qualities associated with our chart more flattering than others. However, our strengths are inextricably linked to our vulnerabilities. Nobody can be and do all things. This is the law of paradox.
