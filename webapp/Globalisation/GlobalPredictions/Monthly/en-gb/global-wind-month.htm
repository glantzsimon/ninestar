    A 4 Tree month carries the gentle, expansive energy of mid- to late spring. After the bold burst of 3 Tree, this phase brings more flow and continuity. It’s a time of organic growth, emotional openness, and deeper engagement with life. Where 3 Tree acts like a spark, 4 Tree unfolds like a breeze—constant, flexible, and subtly influential. You may find yourself feeling more expressive, more socially attuned, and more inspired by beauty or harmony.

    Emotionally, this month can bring a lightness of being. You may feel more playful and optimistic, with a desire to connect, communicate, and share ideas. It’s an excellent time for nurturing relationships and building on recent progress. There’s a sense of emotional intelligence available now—the ability to read between the lines and respond with tact and empathy.

    However, this increased receptivity and engagement also comes with a vulnerability to being blown off course. The wind energy can stir up indecision, scattered focus, or emotional inconsistency. One moment you may feel radiant and connected; the next, uncertain or easily overwhelmed. It’s important to anchor yourself during this time—whether through routine, rest, or spiritual practices that help you stay grounded amidst movement.

<p>
    Socially, you may feel drawn to beautiful environments, gentle company, or engaging conversations. This is a wonderful time to host gatherings, explore creative collaborations, or enjoy cultural experiences. You’re more magnetic this month, and your energy tends to uplift those around you. However, if you’re not grounded, this same charisma can become flirtatious, erratic, or insincere.

    On the physical and energetic level, a Wind month can be depleting if you spread yourself too thin. Like the wind itself, your energy may become dispersed. It’s wise to balance outward momentum with time for reflection and integration. Nourishing the nervous system is key now—consider practices like Yin yoga, Tai Chi, or nature walks to help settle the mind and restore balance.
</p>
<p>
    If your native energy is rooted in Earth or Metal, you might find this month a little too fast-moving or unpredictable. If that’s the case, give yourself permission to move at your own rhythm. The wisdom of 4 Tree lies in its ability to bend without breaking—so be soft, be flexible, but don’t lose your roots.
