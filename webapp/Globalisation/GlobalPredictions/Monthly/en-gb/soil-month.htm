    The seed begins to stir, gently pushing its way up through the soil.

    A 2 Soil month represents the quiet moment before spring—when the stillness of winter begins to soften and we feel the subtle stirrings of new life beneath the surface. It is a month of transition, where our awareness gently shifts from reflection to intention. Though the outward world may still appear motionless, inwardly we are starting to take stock and prepare for the growth to come.
</p>
<p>
    Emotionally, this month can bring a mix of hesitancy and hopefulness. There may be a lingering sense of tiredness or even heaviness from the winter period, yet we also feel the urge to begin envisioning new plans. It’s a tender time—not quite ready to leap forward, but no longer willing to remain still. Because of this tension between where we’ve been and where we’re headed, it's important to move gently and to allow ourselves plenty of space to think things through.
</p>
<p>
    You may find yourself feeling unusually sensitive to your environment and the people around you. Worry or anxiety may arise more easily, especially in the form of concern for others or second-guessing your own readiness to move forward. This is a time when we can be more emotionally impressionable, so it’s wise to ground yourself through simple routines and nourishing activities.
</p>
<p>
    Socialising may feel a little forced or draining this month, particularly for those who are more naturally active or extroverted. It’s perfectly okay to take a step back. Instead, focus on nurturing close, familiar connections and taking time for quiet conversation and reflection. A warm cup of tea with a trusted friend may do far more for your spirit than a crowded event.
</p>
<p>
    This is also a powerful time for getting organised—emotionally and practically. Clean out clutter, review your plans, and begin laying the groundwork for what’s to come. Think of this month as preparing the soil before planting: everything done now sets the tone for how the rest of the year will unfold.
</p>
<p>
    Above all, be kind to yourself. This is not a time for bold moves or big leaps. It is a time to honour slowness, to respect the process of emergence, and to trust that just below the surface, something is beginning to grow.
