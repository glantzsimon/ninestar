    7 Metal — Reflection, Pleasure, and Emotional Exposure
</h5>
<p>
    The 7 Metal phase brings a softening of global energy after the hard lines and moral rigor of 6 Metal. It is the late autumn of the cycle—a time of enjoyment, refinement, and release. Collectively, this phase encourages a pause from striving. There is more focus on comfort, beauty, and emotional connection, but also a subtle vulnerability. Underneath the surface, deeper truths may begin to rise. The global mood becomes more reflective, and while the world may appear more relaxed, profound emotional shifts are quietly unfolding.

    Politically and socially, this phase often sees the public turning its attention toward quality of life, personal freedoms, and the aesthetics of living. Cultural life may flourish—art, music, fashion, and entertainment receive more attention. Diplomacy often takes a gentler tone. However, because 7 Metal is linked with hidden emotion and delayed expression, this period may also bring unexpected revelations—scandals, confessions, or the collapse of illusions that had previously gone unquestioned.

    Economically, this can be a period of both reward and indulgence. Gains from previous hard work may materialize, and spending may increase—sometimes irresponsibly. If the energy remains unchecked, this can lead to waste, distraction, or superficiality. Yet when approached with awareness, it’s a time for savoring life and reestablishing emotional balance. Public interest may shift from survival to satisfaction, from building to enjoying what has been built.

    Environmentally, 7 Metal brings attention to air, breath, and balance. It often reflects issues of environmental fairness, beauty, and what is being discarded or held onto emotionally and materially. It's also a time when climate grief or environmental nostalgia may rise to the surface—an awareness of what is being lost and what still might be preserved.
</p>
<p>
    Spiritually, the collective is invited to soften. To feel more, speak more gently, and allow vulnerability to be a source of strength rather than shame. If the world can resist the urge to numb or distract, this can be a powerful time of emotional integration and healing. It is not about solving everything, but about allowing space for joy, sadness, and truth to coexist without needing immediate resolution.
