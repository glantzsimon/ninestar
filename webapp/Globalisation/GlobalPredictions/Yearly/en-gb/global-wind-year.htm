    The seedling is growing rapidly with many leaves and shoots appearing.

    This year corresponds to mid-morning or mid-to-late spring—a time of steady, expansive growth. The initial burst of energy that emerged last year now begins to take form. Progress continues, and if the groundwork was laid thoughtfully in the past, life flows with ease and grace.

    This is often a joyful and communicative period. Relationships flourish, new opportunities arise, and optimism fills the air. We feel bright, expressive, and open to connection. Many find that their voice and presence carry more influence now, making this an excellent time for outreach, teaching, writing, or public communication.
</p>
<p>
    Yet, this is also a time marked by the unpredictable nature of spring. A changeable breeze may tempt us to shift direction or abandon what we’ve already begun. We must resist the urge to start over too hastily. Just as a farmer wouldn’t tear up seedlings mid-growth, we too must remain consistent in nurturing the projects and paths already in motion. Impulsiveness or scattered energy can undermine real progress.

    With the abundance of mental and physical energy available, it’s easy to overextend. We may become forgetful, disorganized, or overly eager, which can lead to burnout or missed details. The challenge now is to temper enthusiasm with mindfulness—to look, think, then act.

    Those with Metal or Earth energies may feel somewhat uncomfortable during this time, as the expansive nature of Tree energy can unseat their preference for structure, stability, or control. Regular self-care and grounding practices can help restore balance.

    With the energetic rise of Tree energy, physical movement and expression increase. This brings vitality, but also greater risk of accidents or overexertion. Grounding activities—like vigorous walking, stretching, or breathwork—are recommended to stabilize the nervous system and discharge excess energy.

    In Chinese medicine, Tree corresponds with the liver and gallbladder. These organs support vision, planning, and decisiveness, but when out of balance, may contribute to frustration, tension, or digestive discomfort. Avoid late-night eating and overly rich foods. Keeping the throat, chest, and upper body protected from wind and chill is also wise.
</p>
<p>
    Earth (2, 5, 8) and Metal (6, 7) types should be especially attentive to maintaining warmth in the respiratory system and supporting digestion. Though the season brings momentum, the key to success lies in moderation, patience, and clear vision.
