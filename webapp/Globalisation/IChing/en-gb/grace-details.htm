<h5>Grace</h5>
<p>Grace symbolizes beauty, refinement, and the power of outward appearances. It suggests a time when elegance and harmony enhance life, making even difficult situations more bearable. However, true grace must be rooted in substance, not mere decoration.</p>
<p>This hexagram advises maintaining dignity and poise in all circumstances. A refined approach, rather than force, will yield better results. However, one should ensure that appearances align with genuine qualities, avoiding superficiality.</p>
<p>On a deeper level, Grace reminds one that beauty comes from inner harmony. When one cultivates kindness, wisdom, and sincerity, their presence naturally radiates grace. True refinement is an expression of a balanced and enlightened spirit.</p>
