<h5>Da You (Possession In Great Measure)</h5>
<p>Da You represents abundance, great resources, and the potential for vast success. It signifies a time when one possesses wealth, influence, or knowledge that can be used to achieve great things.</p>
<p>However, with great abundance comes great responsibility. This hexagram warns against arrogance or misuse of resources. True wealth is not just material but also found in wisdom, generosity, and ethical conduct.</p>
<p>On a spiritual level, Da You teaches that the greatest possession is inner virtue. When wealth, power, or success is aligned with integrity, it benefits not only oneself but also the broader world.</p>
