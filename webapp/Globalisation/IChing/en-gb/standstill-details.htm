<h5>Pi (Standstill)</h5>
<p>Pi signifies a period of blockages and difficulty. It represents disharmony between forces, leading to stagnation, frustration, and an inability to move forward. It is a warning that something is out of balance and needs correction.</p>
<p>During times of stagnation, it is wise to reflect on the situation rather than forcing progress. Obstacles should be analyzed calmly, and efforts should be directed towards small, internal adjustments rather than large external actions.</p>
<p>On a spiritual level, Pi teaches patience and endurance. Difficult times are part of the natural cycle, and wisdom lies in recognizing when to wait and when to act. By maintaining integrity and perseverance, the situation will eventually shift.</p>
