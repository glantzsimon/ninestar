<h5>Shi (The Army)</h5>
<p>Shi represents discipline, leadership, and the structured force of a well-organized group. It speaks of the power found in unity and coordinated effort, whether in military endeavors, teamwork, or societal structures.</p>
<p>This hexagram emphasizes strategy and responsibility. Leadership must be guided by wisdom and fairness, not brute force. Without proper direction, even the strongest army will fall into chaos. Discipline and moral clarity are essential for success.</p>
<p>On a deeper level, Shi reminds one of the inner battle between order and disorder. Mastering the self requires discipline, just as leading others demands wisdom. When strength is aligned with virtue, great achievements become possible.</p>
