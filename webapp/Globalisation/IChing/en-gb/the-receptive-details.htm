<h5>Kun (The Receptive)</h5>
<p>Kun represents the receptive, nurturing qualities of the Earth. It is the complement to Qian, embodying patience, support, and adaptability. Where Qian initiates action, Kun follows with devotion, allowing things to take their natural course.</p> 
<p>This hexagram advises embracing humility and openness. It suggests that success comes from yielding rather than forcing, from being receptive rather than aggressive. The power of Kun lies in its ability to nourish and sustain, much like the Earth provides for all living things.</p> 
<p>Spiritually, Kun teaches surrender to the greater forces at work in the universe. It encourages trust in divine timing and the wisdom of allowing life to unfold as it should. When one aligns with Kun, they cultivate deep inner peace and the ability to serve as a steady, grounding presence for others.</p>
