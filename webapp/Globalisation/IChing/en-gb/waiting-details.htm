<h5>Xu (Waiting)</h5>
<p>Xu symbolizes the need for patience and trust in the timing of life. It represents a period where action is not yet possible or advisable, requiring one to endure delays with faith. Just as a traveler waits for the right conditions to cross a river, sometimes waiting is the wisest choice.</p>
<p>This hexagram teaches the value of preparation and inner stability. It suggests maintaining composure and using this time to gather resources, reflect, and plan. Impulsiveness will only lead to frustration, while patience ensures success when the time is right.</p>
<p>On a deeper level, Xu speaks of trust in the unfolding of fate. Sometimes forces beyond our control shape our circumstances, and struggling against them is futile. Learning to wait with grace and confidence allows one to flow harmoniously with the rhythms of existence.</p>
