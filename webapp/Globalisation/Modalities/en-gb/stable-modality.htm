    Energies {soil}, {coreearth}, and {mountain} are considered ‘stable’. All three belong to the Earth element, which is by nature grounded, dependable, and enduring. This group shares qualities with the Fixed Modality in Western astrology and the <strong>Relational Group</strong> in Chinese astrology—represented by signs like the Rabbit, Sheep, Pig, and Rat—known for their empathy, emotional intelligence, and commitment to harmony. Like these archetypes, stable energies form the emotional glue of families and communities, offering cohesion, kindness, and quiet strength.

    These energies are oriented toward long-term goals and prefer to plan carefully before taking action. Once committed, they tend to persevere with patience and dedication. Their sense of timing is slow and deliberate—they do not rush.

    Information is processed thoughtfully and incrementally. They prefer to weigh decisions carefully and often rely on accumulated experience rather than impulse. Their memory for details and patterns tends to be strong, and their natural skepticism makes them cautious about change—especially change initiated by others. In this way, they are often the most resistant to outside influence.

    While they can be either introverted or extroverted (with Yang types expressing more outwardly), stable energies are generally less verbally or emotionally expressive than their Dynamic counterparts. Yet, they offer care in the form of loyalty, consistency, and grounded presence. They are often deeply social—empathetic, reliable, and quietly thoughtful.

    Stable energies are the bedrock of human society. Without their steadiness, structure, and care, our lives—and our communities—would lose their centre.
