<h4>Karmic Evolution</h4>
<p><strong>Karmic Evolution</strong> reflects the shifting numerological influences that shape each 27-year period of life. These secondary energies do not replace the Primary Karmic Blueprint but instead build upon it, adding depth and new dimensions to one’s journey. Different phases of life bring unique lessons, challenges, and areas for growth, calling for shifts in focus and action. As we evolve, these influences guide us through cycles of transformation, helping us align with our purpose, refine our understanding, and embrace the wisdom each stage has to offer.</p>
