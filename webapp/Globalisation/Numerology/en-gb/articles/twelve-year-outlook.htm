<h4>Twelve Year Outlook</h4>
<p>The <strong>Twelve Year Outlook</strong> serves as a map of the next 12 years, revealing the cyclical nature of karmic influences. Each year is guided by the energy of one of the nine karmic numbers, introducing different themes and lessons, much like the changing seasons bring shifts in climate and activity. These energies help shape our focus, directing us toward specific areas of growth, action, and transformation. Unlike the Gregorian calendar, the start and end dates of these cycles align with celestial movements, reflecting the influence of the stars and their positions in shaping our journey.</p>
