    <strong>
        Challenging Period – Prone to Accidents, Health Issues, and Business Adjustments  
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This is a time for caution and reflection, as conflicting energies create tension between action and introspection. The inward pull of the heart (4) urges deep self-examination and emotional awareness, prompting you to assess how you truly feel before making decisions. However, this introspective energy is countered by the restless and reactive force of the expression center (5), which drives an urge to take immediate action. This internal struggle can lead to impulsive decisions, increasing the risk of accidents or stress-related health concerns, particularly affecting the stomach. It is also a pivotal period for reassessing business matters—trimming unnecessary commitments and making thoughtful adjustments. To navigate this phase successfully, slow down, listen to your intuition, and act with mindfulness rather than impulse.
