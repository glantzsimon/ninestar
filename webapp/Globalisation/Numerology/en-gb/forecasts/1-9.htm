    <strong>
        Strong Mental Conviction but Limited Action – Ideal for Collaborative Efforts  
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This period fosters confidence in thought and opinion, yet translating ideas into decisive action may prove challenging. The energy of creativity and initiative (1) is present, but external resistance from others (2) may create obstacles or slow momentum. However, with proper focus and balance, this phase offers an excellent opportunity to initiate or further develop projects that involve partnerships, teamwork, or collective efforts. Rather than forcing individual progress, success is more likely when working through associations, where shared vision and mutual support can help overcome hesitations and resistance. Strategic planning and cooperation will maximize the potential of this time.
