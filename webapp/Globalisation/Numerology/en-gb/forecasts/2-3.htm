    <strong>
        Mental Conflict Between Action and Reflection – Change, Travel, and Inner Tension  
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This period begins with an influx of inspiring new ideas (5), sparking a desire for movement and change. However, there is an internal struggle between the urge to take immediate action and the need for introspection. Rather than rushing forward, it is wiser to pause, reflect, and allow deeper insights to emerge from higher awareness (7). Major decisions, particularly those involving change or travel, are likely to reach a positive resolution, but patience will be key. The tension between activity and inner contemplation may also manifest physically, potentially leading to stress-related issues such as digestive discomfort or ulcers. Engaging in writing, journaling, or other creative expressions can be a productive way to channel this mental energy while allowing clarity to unfold naturally.
