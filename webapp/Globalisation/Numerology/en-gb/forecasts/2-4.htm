    This period brings greater clarity regarding material and financial matters (6), making it an opportune time for making sound economic decisions. Whether related to family income, business ventures, or investments, choices made now have the potential to yield prosperity and long-term stability. Additionally, any lingering quarrels or disputes are likely to reach a resolution, paving the way for greater harmony in personal or professional relationships. Beyond financial success, this cycle also holds deeper significance at a spiritual level (8), offering a sense of unity, purpose, and rewards that extend beyond the material realm. Aligning both practical and spiritual perspectives will ensure that decisions made now contribute to overall well-being and fulfillment.
