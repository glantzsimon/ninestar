        Challenges in Settling Affairs – A Key Time for Reflection and Inner Growth  
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This period may bring some difficulties in resolving practical matters, but rather than forcing solutions, it is a time to turn inward. Inspiration and insight can be found by connecting with the universal reality (7), exploring the deeper lessons and underlying reasons behind current experiences. The energy of this phase encourages a heightened awareness of the bigger picture—the interconnectedness of all things and the journey of the self within the greater whole (9). By embracing contemplation, meditation, and spiritual reflection, you can gain wisdom, clarity, and renewed perspective. This is an opportunity to strengthen your inner foundation and align more deeply with the flow of life, allowing guidance to emerge naturally.
