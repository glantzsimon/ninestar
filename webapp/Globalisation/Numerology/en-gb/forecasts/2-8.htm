        A Strong Start for Creativity and Action – Caution Against Overextension  
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    The first half of this period is highly favorable for initiating projects, self-expression, and taking decisive action. Physical energy is strong (1), and creativity flows abundantly, making it an excellent time to accomplish tasks and bring ideas to life (3). Enthusiasm and optimism may be heightened, fueling productivity and momentum. However, there is a risk of overcommitting or pushing too hard without considering long-term sustainability. As the period progresses, it is essential to slow down and allow space for intuitive insights to emerge. These moments of reflection will help balance output and prevent burnout or disappointment. By maintaining awareness and pacing efforts wisely, you can maximize the benefits of this energetic cycle while ensuring a smooth transition into the next phase.
