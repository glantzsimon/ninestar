    <strong>
        A Quiet, Reflective Period – Ideal for Inner Work and Healing  
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This phase encourages introspection and solitude, making it an excellent time for working in silence and focusing on personal healing. Emotional awareness takes center stage (4), allowing for deep reflection on life’s circumstances and the emotions tied to them. While the body benefits from rest and recuperation, the mind is naturally inclined to review past experiences, seeking meaning and clarity. The energy of heightened awareness (7) may bring valuable insights, but rather than taking immediate action, this is a time to process thoughts through writing, contemplation, or creative expression. Toward the end of this cycle, inspiration begins to emerge, potentially leading to a significant realization or a delayed but impactful statement. Use this period for inner growth, trusting that clarity will unfold in its own time.
