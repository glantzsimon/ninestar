    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This period serves as a powerful reminder that actions taken now will have immediate consequences, making it an essential time to act with mindfulness and integrity. It is a favorable moment for initiating new endeavors (1), particularly those rooted in selfless service and the principles of Karma Yoga. Acts of generosity, kindness, and working for the benefit of others will yield meaningful results, both materially and spiritually. To navigate this phase successfully, it is important to stay connected to your heart center (4), ensuring that all actions stem from a place of sincerity and compassion. By aligning efforts with higher purpose, this cycle offers an opportunity to plant positive seeds that will quickly come to fruition.
