    <strong>
        A Time for Expansion – New Connections, Fresh Opportunities, and Refining Relationships  
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This period is highly dynamic, bringing opportunities to meet new people who can provide valuable inspiration and support for upcoming projects. Your energy is particularly engaging and motivating to others (2), making it an excellent time for collaboration, networking, and forming meaningful partnerships. Sharing fresh ideas and allowing them to gain momentum through social circles and broader networks (5) can lead to exciting possibilities. At the same time, this phase also presents an opportunity for evaluating relationships—letting go of connections that no longer serve your growth while fostering those that align with your aspirations. By embracing both expansion and refinement, you can make the most of this vibrant and transformative period.
