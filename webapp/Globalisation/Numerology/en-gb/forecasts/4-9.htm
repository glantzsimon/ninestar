        A Time for Settlements, Hard Work, and Mindful Effort – Proceed with Caution  
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This period calls for careful attention to financial matters, outstanding obligations, and the completion of responsibilities. Rewards may come, but only through persistent effort and diligence. It is important to move cautiously, paying close attention to details to avoid missteps. Beginning the day with meditation can provide clarity, helping to align actions with the principles of Karma Yoga—reflecting on whether our work and service truly embody selflessness and purpose (4). This is also a time for clearing the past, making amends where needed, and seeking ways to contribute positively to others. While the process may feel demanding, there is deep fulfillment to be found in recognizing the impact of our actions (8). By staying focused and embracing patience, this phase can bring lasting growth and stability.
