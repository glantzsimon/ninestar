    <strong>
        A Cycle of Shifting Energy – From Creativity to Introspection, Avoid Overextension  
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This period begins with a strong inner drive for creative expression and action (3), fueling enthusiasm and a desire to accomplish something meaningful. However, as the cycle progresses, the energy shifts, bringing a pull toward introspection and emotional sensitivity. While the initial momentum may feel exciting and productive, overextending yourself could lead to frustration or exhaustion. The latter part of this phase encourages a quieter, more reflective state (7), where deep emotions surface, potentially creating inner conflict. Instead of resisting this shift, embrace the need for solitude and self-exploration. Balancing action with mindful retreat will help prevent burnout and allow for a smoother transition into the next phase.
