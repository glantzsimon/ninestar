    <strong>
        A Positive Yet Testing Period – Financial Caution and Inner Reflection  
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    While this period carries the potential for rewards and financial growth (8), it is not a time for active buying, selling, or making major financial moves. Instead, this phase serves as a test, urging patience and mindful observation rather than immediate action. The best approach is to embrace stillness—find a quiet space to reflect, express gratitude for what you have, and assess your relationship with abundance (4). Observing your feelings around wealth, security, and material stability can offer valuable insights, helping you align future decisions with a deeper sense of balance. Trust that what is meant for you will come in due time, and avoid forcing outcomes during this introspective phase.
