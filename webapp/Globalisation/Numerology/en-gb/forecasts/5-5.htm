        A Balanced and Productive Period – Ideal for Decisions and New Projects  
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This phase offers a steady and well-balanced energy, making it an excellent time for making thoughtful decisions, particularly regarding projects and long-term goals. It is a favorable period for initiating new endeavors (1), provided they are approached with a clear vision and a practical mindset. Financially, this may be a time of paying out rather than receiving, but such investments are likely to support future growth. With a stable and grounded perspective (6), this cycle encourages measured actions and well-reasoned choices, allowing for steady progress without unnecessary risk. Trust in a methodical approach, and use this time to build a strong foundation for future success.
