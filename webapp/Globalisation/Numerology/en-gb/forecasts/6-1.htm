    <strong>
        A Period of Introversion – Emotional Processing and Inner Awareness  
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This phase may bring feelings of withdrawal, emotional repression, or a sense of being tested. Rather than resisting these emotions, it is a time to turn inward and focus on self-awareness and healing (4). Through quiet contemplation, mindfulness, or yoga practice, this period can become deeply intuitive and spiritually enriching. Paying close attention to both physical and emotional sensations can reveal valuable insights, offering clarity and personal growth (7). By embracing stillness and allowing emotions to surface without judgment, you can navigate this introspective cycle with wisdom and emerge with a renewed sense of inner balance.
