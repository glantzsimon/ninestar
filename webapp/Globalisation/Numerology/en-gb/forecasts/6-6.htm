    <strong>
        A Highly Emotional Period – Passion, Challenges in Associations, and the Need for Reflection  
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This period is marked by heightened emotions and intense passion, which may bring both opportunities and challenges, particularly in relationships and associations. If you took the time to resolve matters in the previous cycle, this will lead to dynamic progress and advancement (9). However, the surge of optimism and energy can become overwhelming, leading to overreactions or impulsive decisions (3). It is essential to maintain moderation and stay grounded during the first half of the cycle. Keep karma in mind and practice patience. In the latter half, allow space for quiet reflection and introspection, carefully considering your next steps. This is a time for making thoughtful resolutions and moving forward with clarity, ensuring that emotional impulses do not cloud your judgment.
