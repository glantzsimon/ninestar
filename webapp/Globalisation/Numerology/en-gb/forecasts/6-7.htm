        A Time to Start with Caution – Focus on Details and Mindful Action  
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This period is favorable for starting new ventures, but it requires a careful, detail-oriented approach. Avoid rushing into anything without fully considering the potential outcomes and implications. This is a time for selfless action, focusing on Karma Yoga (4), and setting aside personal desires and attachments (1). When approached with patience and mindfulness, results can manifest quickly, providing immediate feedback and rewards. By keeping your actions aligned with higher purpose and staying grounded in the present moment, you can navigate this period with wisdom and integrity, ensuring that any new beginnings are built on solid foundations.
