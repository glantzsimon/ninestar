    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This period is favorable for making decisions related to family, finances, and organizational matters. It’s an excellent time to assess income and determine the best way to utilize it (8). Rewards are likely to come your way, and it’s important to pause and reflect on their sources, appreciating the efforts and circumstances that have contributed to your financial success. By taking time to contemplate (6), you can plan for the future with a clearer sense of purpose, ensuring that decisions are thoughtful and aligned with your long-term goals. While small worries may arise, they can be easily managed through careful planning and mindful consideration of your next steps.
