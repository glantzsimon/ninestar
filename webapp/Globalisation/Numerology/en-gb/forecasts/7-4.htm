    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This phase may bring emotional turbulence, especially within relationships, making it an important time to be mindful of what you say. It is a time for deep contemplation on how we relate to others, how we communicate our needs, and how we can express ourselves with compassion (2). With the right attitude, this can be a very positive time for gaining clarity on relational dynamics. Before speaking, it is essential to reflect on the situation (9), ensuring that words are chosen with care and understanding. By taking a moment to pause and reflect, you can navigate this emotionally charged period with wisdom, fostering stronger, more compassionate connections.
