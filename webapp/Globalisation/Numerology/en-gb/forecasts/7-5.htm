    <strong>
        A Cycle of High Optimism – Starting Strong, Ending with Reflection  
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This period begins with a surge of energy and transformation (3), filled with optimism and the drive to take action. The first half is highly productive and favorable for starting new ventures and pursuing ambitious goals. However, as the cycle progresses, it is important to be mindful of over-optimism. The latter half of the period brings a shift toward introspection and intuition, requiring a slowdown and a more thoughtful, reflective approach (1). This quieter phase encourages tuning into your feelings and reassessing your path. By allowing space for this inward journey, you can maintain balance and avoid the pitfalls of overextending yourself.
