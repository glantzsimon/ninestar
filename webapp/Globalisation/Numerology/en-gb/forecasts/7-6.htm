        A Time for Detail Work and Collaboration – Staying Mindful of Overwhelm  
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This period calls for a focus on the details, especially in relationships and collaborations. While it is a good time to work with others and refine important tasks, be cautious not to get bogged down in minutiae or become overly absorbed in the process. This is an intuitive and sensitive time, where compassion (4) plays a key role. Trusting your feelings and insights can help you navigate and analyze social situations more effectively. It's also a particularly positive period for healing with others (2), allowing emotional connections to deepen and mutual understanding to grow. By balancing attention to detail with emotional awareness, you can make the most of this time for both personal and collective growth.
