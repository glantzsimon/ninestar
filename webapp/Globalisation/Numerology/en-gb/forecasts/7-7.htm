    <strong>
        A Period of Dynamic Action and Change – Balance with Reflection and Intuition  
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    The first half of this cycle is filled with tremendous energy, driving you toward action and accomplishment (3). It's an ideal time to push forward with new projects, travel, and embrace change, as many fresh ideas and opportunities present themselves. However, as the period progresses, the latter half may bring some disappointment or challenges, prompting a shift in direction. It’s important to approach this phase with balance: check the validity of your ideas and actions by tuning into your intuition and emotions (5). Before making any decisions, take the time to think deeply and reflect on how you truly feel. This will ensure that your choices are aligned with both reason and inner wisdom, leading to more thoughtful and successful outcomes.
