        A Lazy Period with a Tendency Toward Becoming Argumentative: Take Action Early, Seek New Associations, and Brace for a Sad Ending
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This period calls for transformation and action, especially in social situations (2). If approached with compassion and grace, it can lead to positive change. However, it’s important to keep your vision clear, focusing on early accomplishments (3) before shifting into a more reflective mode. As the period progresses, embrace quiet contemplation, perhaps through meditation with others, in the latter half. While there may be a sense of sadness toward the end, this can also serve as an opportunity for deeper insight and growth.
