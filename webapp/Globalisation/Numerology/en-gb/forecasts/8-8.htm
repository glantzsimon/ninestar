        The First Half May Be Challenging Unless Focused on the Spiritual: Decisions Made Early Will Bear Fruit by the End of the Cycle
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    The first half of this period may feel negative unless you focus on the spiritual. It’s a relaxed time (7) ideal for inspired reading or reflection (6), and a chance to cultivate gratitude for what you already have. As the cycle progresses, the latter half brings more rewards and positive outcomes, with the decisions you make early on starting to bear fruit by the end.
