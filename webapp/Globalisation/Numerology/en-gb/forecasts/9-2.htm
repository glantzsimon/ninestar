        A Time to Devote to Social Activities: A Feminine, Passive Time—Beware of Procrastination
    </strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This is a period to expand your social circle and connect with others, utilizing their energy and support to further your projects or inviting them to become part of your endeavors. While it's a time to go with the flow, it’s essential to stay grounded in the inspiration that guided you at the start of this cycle. Avoid getting caught in procrastination, and instead, maintain your focus and remain centered in your own purpose.
