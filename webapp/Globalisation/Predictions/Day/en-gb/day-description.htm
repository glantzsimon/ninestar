    Daily Prediction - Tracks the movement of Ki over cycles of 9 days
</h5>
<p>
    As well as yearly and monthly cycles or 'spirals', there is also a daily energetic rhythm. The daily Ki affects us on a more immediate and energetic level. The energy or 'Ki' of the yearly and monthly cycles is always felt and serves as the overarching influence in our lives. However, the effect of the daily Ki is even more immediate than the monthly influence. It can affect our mood, our energy levels, and also influence the kinds of activities we engage in, as well as when we take rest periods. For example, we could be in the 1 Water house during a given month—a time when we may feel withdrawn, contemplative, and still—but the daily house could be governed by 3 Tree. The influence of Thunder / Spring Energy during that particular day would likely be felt as a welcome break from the heavier, more stagnant feeling of winter. It could be a great time to get lingering tasks done or to go out and socialise.
