    Our lives also move in monthly cycles. The Energy associated with the month affects us on a more immediate and emotional level.

    In addition to the yearly cycles that each our lives move through, there are also smaller, monthly cycles. The energy or 'Ki' of the yearly cycle or 'spiral' is always felt and is the overarching influence in our lives. However, the effect of the monthly ki is more immediate and felt on an emotional level. For example, we could be in the 1 Water house during a year, which can be a time when we feel withdrawn, contemplative and still, but the monthly house could be governed by 3 Tree. The influence of Thunder / spring Energy during that month would likely be felt as a welcomed break from the heavier, more stagnant feeling of winter. It could be a great time to go on holiday or to get stuff done, which had been lingering.

    Note that for those who identify as male, the houses cycle fowards from 1 to 9. For those who identify as female, it is the inverse.
