<h5>Hourly energetic cycles</h5>
<p>
    In addition to the yearly, monthly, and daily cycles, there are also subtle hourly movements within the 9 Star Ki system. Though far more delicate in their influence, these hourly rhythms gently shape the emotional tone and energy of the day—often affecting our focus, mood, and the way we interact with others moment to moment. Becoming attuned to these subtle shifts can help us better understand the natural ebb and flow of our energy throughout the day and guide us toward greater harmony in our thoughts, actions, and rest.
