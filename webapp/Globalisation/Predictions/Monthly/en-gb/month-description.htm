    Monthly Prediction — Reflects the emotional tone and interpersonal focus of the month 
</h5>
<p>
    In addition to the yearly cycles that shape the broader flow of our lives, there are also smaller, monthly cycles. The energy, or 'Ki', of the yearly cycle is always present and serves as the overarching influence. However, the effect of the monthly Ki is more immediate and tends to be felt on an emotional level. For example, we might be in the 1 Water house for the year—a time that often brings feelings of withdrawal, contemplation, and stillness—while the monthly house is governed by 3 Tree. The influence of Thunder / Spring energy during that month could feel like a welcome break from the heavier, more stagnant mood of winter. It might be a great time to travel or tackle projects that had been lingering.
