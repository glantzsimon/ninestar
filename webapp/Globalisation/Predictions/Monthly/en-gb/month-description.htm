    Our lives also move through monthly cycles. The Energy associated with the month affects us on a more immediate and emotional level.

    In addition to the yearly cycles that each our lives move through, there are also smaller, monthly cycles. The energy of the yearly cycle is always felt and is the overarching influence on the direction of our lives. However, the effect of the monthly cycle is more immediate and felt on an emotional level. For example, we could be in a 1 Water year, which can be a time when we feel withdrawn, contemplative and still, but the month Energy could be 3 Tree. The presence of Thunder / spring Energy in our chart during that month would likekly be felt as a welcomed break from the heavier, more stagnant feeling of winter. It could be a great time to go on holiday or to get stuff done, which had been lingering.

    Note that for those who identify as male, the months work backwards from 9 to 1. For those who identify as female, it is the inverse. This reversal of the cycle does not apply to the yearly cycles. This can often seem confusing on the surface, however it has to do with the subtle interplay of Yin and Yang energies and their influence over our lives. It is not necessary to fully understand the exact way in which these energies interact with our reality.
