    This month represents late winter and is a time of planning and slow movement
</h5>
<p>
    During a Soil month, we often still feel the stillness and stagnation of winter, however there is a sense of light at the end of the tunnel and an urge to start planning and moving.

    Socialising can be somewhat challenging during a Soil month as our energy is typically still fairly reserved and introverted. This is a great time for slowing down, making plans and sorting out all the loose ends.
