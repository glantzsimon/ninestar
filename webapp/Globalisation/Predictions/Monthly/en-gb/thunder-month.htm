    The seedling has sprouted, breaking through the surface with a burst of energy.

    A 3 Tree month corresponds to the early stirrings of spring—like the first clap of thunder awakening the still earth. It is a month of movement, energy, and new beginnings. After a period of quiet or planning, the Tree energy propels us forward with a jolt of vitality, urging us to act, speak, and create. Emotionally, it often feels like a switch has been flipped—we feel more animated, expressive, and alive.
</p>
<p>
    This is a time when inspiration often arrives quickly and unexpectedly. We may feel flooded with fresh ideas and compelled to take action. It’s an excellent period for initiating projects, setting plans into motion, or stepping out of your comfort zone. The natural enthusiasm of this month is contagious—others may be drawn to your energy and momentum, making it a great time for collaboration and social connection.

    However, the same energy that makes this month exciting can also feel a bit ungrounding. You may notice that you’re more restless, impulsive, or easily frustrated, especially if things don’t move as fast as you’d like. Emotions can erupt quickly, much like spring storms—clearing the air but sometimes catching us off guard. Take care not to act before thinking, or to leap ahead without considering the consequences.
</p>
<p>
    There is also a playful, childlike quality to the Tree energy—an urge to explore, to be spontaneous, and to enjoy life. This can be incredibly refreshing if you’ve been feeling stagnant. Make time for joy, movement, and laughter. Reconnect with nature. Get outside, breathe in fresh air, and let your body move freely. Creative expression and physical activity are especially beneficial now.
</p>
<p>
    On an emotional level, you may feel more extroverted and expressive—but there can also be a tendency to speak too quickly or say more than intended. Communication is fast and sometimes raw this month. Be mindful of your words and listen carefully to others. Not everyone will be riding the same wave of momentum.
</p>
<p>
    If you’re someone whose base energy is more inward or still—such as Earth or Metal—this month may feel destabilising. That’s okay. Use it as a chance to observe how you respond to rapid change. You don’t need to match the speed; simply stay centred and make intentional, grounded choices as things accelerate around you.
