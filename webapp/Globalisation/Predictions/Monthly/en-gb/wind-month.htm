    This month represents mid morning or mid to late spring
</h5>
<p>
    During a Wind month, we feel the energy of spring, which bring us joy, enthusiasm and optimism.
</p>

    It's important for us not to overdo it during a Wind month, both in terms of getting carried away with things we're involved in as well as being careful not to exhaust ourselves. It's important to rest and to remain grounded.
