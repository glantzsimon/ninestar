<h5>
    The fruits are beginning to ripen
</h5>
<p>
    This year represents early autumn or evening. It is where we begin to see the fruits of our labour; the reward of all the effort put in during the previous years.
</p>
<p>
    This year is associated with the full force of Yang and we often feel confident with a strong sense of direction and purpose.
</p>
<p>
    We may well find that our skills and talents are more noticed by others and that we are rewarded for our efforts, perhaps with a promotion, a pay-rise or perhaps our own business starts to flourish. 
</p>
<p>
    This is also a year when we begin to get much greater clarity and understanding. We feel bolder and better able to express our needs and set healthy boundaries with people. We often feel more focussed and disciplined and our greater sense of confidence can mean that we feel a certain authority; that we are right in our judgments and opinions. Care must be taken not become overbearing, self-righteous or intolerant of others, however.
</p>
<p>
    It is good to keep our goals clearly in focus, but to be mindful of others and to make sure we don't step on anyone's toes.

    Tree and Fire people may feel some discomfort when they occupy this House, as their Energies are in a Challenging Transformation with the Metal element.

    Health

<p>
    Our health is usually good durinng this time and we have lots of stamina; however, we need to make sure we don't overdo it.
    In Chinese medicine, the Metal element controls the lungs and large intestine. If either of these organs gets weak, it can lead to feelings of depression, isolation and melancholy.
