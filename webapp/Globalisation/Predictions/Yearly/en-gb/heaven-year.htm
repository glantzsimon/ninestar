    The fruits are beginning to ripen
</h5>
<p>
    This year corresponds to early autumn or evening—the time when the fruits of our labour begin to ripen. It marks a natural culmination of the effort, discipline, and perseverance we've shown in prior years. What was once merely planted and tended is now beginning to bear results.
</p>
<p>
    The energy of this house is infused with the full force of Yang—clarity, strength, and purpose. We may feel more confident, determined, and focused. Our direction feels clearer. For many, this is a year when recognition comes easily, be it through professional advancement, financial reward, or a deepening sense of inner authority.
</p>
<p>
    We find ourselves able to speak more assertively and to set clearer boundaries. With this new clarity comes a powerful sense of right and wrong, and we may feel quite certain in our opinions. While this can be empowering, we must be mindful not to become overly rigid, controlling, or self-righteous. True leadership is firm, but also kind.
</p>
<p>
    This is a time to sharpen our focus and keep our eyes on the path ahead, but not at the expense of compassion. We may feel emboldened by our achievements, but it’s important to avoid stepping on others as we move forward.
</p>
<p>
    Tree and Fire energies may feel tension in this house, as their dynamic, expressive natures can feel restricted by the controlled, refining quality of Metal. However, this challenge can also offer great growth—an opportunity to balance spontaneity with structure and passion with precision.

    Vitality is usually strong during this time, and we often feel we can accomplish a great deal. However, overexertion is a real risk. Pacing ourselves and allowing time for rest is essential.

    In Chinese medicine, the Metal element is associated with the lungs and large intestine. When balanced, these organs support a deep sense of inner strength and clarity. But if weakened, we may feel isolated, melancholic, or emotionally shut down. Supporting these organs through breathwork, moderate exercise, and emotional release—particularly grief—can be very beneficial now.
</p>
<p>
    As this is a year of momentum, we should also be cautious with movement. Transport accidents or injuries—particularly involving the chest, head, or shoulders—can be more likely, so grounding practices and careful attention to our physical environment are advised.
