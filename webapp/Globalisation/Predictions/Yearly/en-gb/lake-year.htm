    The harvest is in. It's time to celebrate and put one's feet up
</h5>
<p>
    This year corresponds to late autumn or twilight—the golden hour of the Nine Star Ki cycle. It is a time for rest, enjoyment, and gratitude. The hard work of previous years has borne fruit, and now we are invited to savour the harvest, appreciate our accomplishments, and share our abundance with others.
</p>

    Often considered one of the smoothest and most pleasurable Houses to occupy, the Lake year encourages sociability, beauty, and enjoyment. We may feel more drawn to romantic or social encounters, and opportunities for fun, leisure, and connection tend to flow more freely. However, it's important to stay grounded—many of these encounters may be fleeting, and there’s a risk of becoming overly consumed by the pleasure of the moment.
</p>
<p>
    This is a year where financial windfalls, pleasant surprises, or rewards from earlier investments may arise. Things seem to flow more easily now, and many find themselves more at ease—less burdened and more open to joy.
</p>
<p>
    But with ease comes the temptation to overindulge. A carefree spirit is natural at this time, but without mindfulness, we may lose focus, make poor decisions, or become distracted by superficial pleasures. To balance this outward expression, it is also a wonderful time to cultivate our spiritual side, reflect on the past cycle, and prepare—gently and without pressure—for what’s to come.
</p>
<p>
    Miscommunications are possible this year, especially if we become too preoccupied with appearances or forget to speak with sincerity. Staying open-hearted but honest will help avoid unnecessary misunderstandings.

    Those with Water or Tree Energies may find this House less comfortable than others. The reflective, fluid nature of Water and the upward movement of Tree can feel unsettled by the smooth, contained energy of Metal.

    Health
</h5>
<p>
    Health is generally strong during this time, and many experience a renewed sense of vitality. In Chinese medicine, the Metal element governs the lungs and large intestine. These organs are linked with grief, elimination, and letting go. If imbalanced, feelings of melancholy or emotional stagnation may surface, especially if we haven’t made space to process what we’ve outgrown.
</p>
<p>
    Breathwork, gentle movement, and open-hearted communication are especially beneficial now. It is also wise to monitor indulgent habits—especially those involving food, alcohol, or sensory pleasure—and to gently bring ourselves back to centre when needed.
