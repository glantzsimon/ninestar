    The seedling has sprouted, breaking through the top layer of soil with a tremendous burst of energy.

    This House represents early spring—dawn in the Nine Star Ki cycle—where the energy of new growth surges upward with a sense of urgency and vitality. It is a time of breakthrough, when momentum builds and creative ideas flow freely. Plans made in the previous cycle can now take root in action.
</p>
<p>
    With this upward movement comes enthusiasm, confidence, and expressive energy. It is a time to begin, to move, to experiment. There is a natural desire to set things in motion and explore new territories—emotionally, creatively, or even geographically. Travel, learning, and bold new ventures are especially supported now.
</p>
<p>
    However, this rush of spring energy can also make us impatient. We may be tempted to skip over important details in our excitement to move forward. Stay mindful: not everything must be accomplished at once. Progress is likely, but it must be grounded in awareness. Balance action with reflection.
</p>
<p>
    There may be occasional emotional turbulence. Even calm personalities may find themselves speaking more loudly, reacting more impulsively, or becoming easily frustrated when plans are thwarted. This is simply the Tree energy rising—it is Yang, expressive, and dynamic. The key is to stay connected to the body and give this energy somewhere to go.
</p>
<p>
    To balance this high activity, incorporate more Yin-based practices—meditation, yoga, slow walks in nature, or creative solitude. These moments of stillness help prevent burnout and keep the nervous system regulated.
</p>
<p>
    While this is generally a fortunate and high-energy time, it's important to remain sensitive to the fact that others may be in quieter, less expansive cycles. Allow your confidence to inspire—but not overwhelm—those around you.
</p>
<p>
    Metal and Earth individuals may feel particularly off-balance during this period, as their more structured or grounded energies are challenged by the expansive nature of the Tree element.

    With so much energy comes an increased risk of physical overexertion or accidents. This is a time to stay active—but also alert. In Chinese medicine, the Tree element is associated with the liver and gallbladder, as well as the connective tissue and muscles. It’s especially important to avoid overeating, eating late at night, or consuming overly oily or heavy foods.
</p>
<p>
    Imbalances in these organs can contribute to increased irritability, tension, and frustration. Supporting the body with regular physical movement, adequate hydration, and plenty of fresh air is essential. Avoiding strong easterly winds, especially in spring, and cultivating flexibility—physically and emotionally—will help maintain balance.
</p>
<p>
    Earth (2, 5, 8) and Metal (6, 7) types should be especially mindful of their limits during this phase. Channel your energy wisely, and allow inspiration to rise from a well-supported foundation.
