    This year represents night and winter. It is cold, dark, and still—the seed remains hidden in the ground.
</h5>
<p>
    This is a time of hibernation, retreat, and deep reflection. The House of Water, associated with the north and the depth of winter, invites us to pause and turn inward. There is little movement on the surface, yet beneath the stillness, something vital is gestating. It is a time for dreaming rather than doing, for looking within rather than pushing ahead.
</p>
<p>
    The wisdom of this house lies in quietude. It is not the season to start new ventures or take bold leaps. Attempts to force movement or growth may result in setbacks or wasted energy. Instead, this is a period for nurturing your inner world—gathering insight, restoring your strength, and connecting with your deeper intentions for the coming cycle. Ideas and inspiration come most powerfully when we are still.
</p>
<p>
    During this year, you may feel more withdrawn or unexpressive. Friends and associates might seem distant, and you may find yourself unusually sensitive or uncertain in your relationships. This is not rejection—it is a reflection of your own energetic quietness. There is, however, a strong intuitive current flowing beneath the surface. If embraced with calmness, it can guide you with remarkable clarity. If overstimulated or stressed, it may turn into hypersensitivity or even fearfulness.
</p>
<p>
    You may experience feelings of melancholy or stagnation, as if your dreams are out of reach. But this is not failure—it is gestation. Like seeds beneath the snow, your ideas and hopes are gathering strength in the quiet dark. Trust in the timing. Movement will return.
</p>
<p>
    Financially, this is a time to be cautious. Avoid unnecessary expenses and wait to launch new plans or investments until this energy has passed. It is a good time for research, contemplation, or quiet study. What you learn now will serve you well in the active years to come.
</p>
<p>
    Fire and Earth energies may find this period particularly challenging, as their nature resists the stillness and subtlety of Water. But by surrendering to the pause and finding comfort in quiet, they too can draw great strength and clarity from this house.

    Health

<p>
    The Water element in Chinese medicine governs the kidneys, bladder, adrenal glands, and reproductive system, as well as all bodily fluids—blood, lymph, water, and semen. During this year, these organs and functions are recharging. Prioritise rest and avoid cold, damp environments and foods. Choose warming, mineral-rich meals, lightly salted and gently spiced. Reduce stimulants such as alcohol and coffee.
</p>
<p>
    Avoid overexertion, and instead engage in gentle practices like Yin Yoga, breathwork, or walking meditation. Be cautious around liquids—whether through poor-quality water, damp environments, or excess alcohol intake. This is also a good time to support your immune and lymphatic systems with warmth, hydration, and stillness.
</p>
<p>
    Those with natal numbers 9, 2, and 5 should take particular care during this year, as they are more sensitive to the subtle energetics of the Water house.
