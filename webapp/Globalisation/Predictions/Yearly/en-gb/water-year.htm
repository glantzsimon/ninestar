    This year represents night and winter. It's cold, dark and still. The seed is still in the ground.

<p>
    This is a time for hibernation, deep rest and reflection. A time for pondering what one wishes to create during the next 9 year cycle.
</p>
<p>
    During this year, it is common to feel withdrawn and uncommunicative. Others may appear to keep their distance and we may feel vulnerable, hypersensitive and even fearful at times. It's a bit like when we are asleep and we need to make sure we are in a safe place and protected.
</p>
<p>
    It is also not uncommon for our health to be more vulnerable during a Water year. We need to make sure we take plenty of rest and that we tend to the needs of our body.
</p>
<p>
    It can also feel as though all of our dreams are out of reach and that we are stagnating in life. However, it is also the time when our intuition is at its strongest. This can help us to tune in and see the bigger picture, which can guide us in charting our plans for the next cycle of growth.
</p>
<p>
    This is not the most auspicious time for starting new projects and endeavours. There could well be many misunderstandings and obstacles that get in the way.  It is a time for dreaming; a time for slowing down, resting and recharing one's batteries. Ideas and inspiration come when we are still.
</p>
<p>
    This is also an excellent time for developing our spiritual nature. Meditation, yoga and other similar practises are immensely helpful during this time.

    Fire and Earth Energies are most likely to feel discomfort when they occupy this House, as their Energies are in a Challenging Transformation with the Water element.

    The Water element in Chinese medicine is associated with the health of the urinary and reproductive systems, such as the bladder, kidneys, adrenals glands, etc. During this year, these organs recharge themselves. This is another reason why it is especiall important to get adequate rest during this time. It is advised to avoid cold and damp environments and foods. It is more nourishing to eat warming, salty and lightly spiced foods.
