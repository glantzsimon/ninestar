    Our lives pass through nine-year cycles, with each year representing one of the nine Energies of the 9 Star Ki system.

    Not only does each person have a 9 Star Ki profile, which is determined by their date of birth, but in addition, each of our lives passes through nine-year cycles. Each year represents one of the nine Energies of the 9 Star Ki system and influences our lives in powerful ways. 
</p>
<h5>
    These nine-year cycles are seasonal in nature, with a spring, summer, autumn and winter period
</h5>
<p>
    Another way to imagine it is that our lives go through seasonal changes, just like the spring, summer, autumn, winter; however, it is a nine-year cycle, rather than a yearly one. During the "summer" part of the cycle, we are closest to the sun and feel warmer, more energised and extroverted. Conversely, during the "winter" part of the cycle we are more likely to feel withdrawn, cool and introspective.

    There is a time to sow and a time to harvest. Understanding where we are in the cosmic cycles and moving with the energy, not against it, can be tremendously powerful

    People who are in touch with Nature and her cycles understand the seasonal changes that occur throughout the year. They know that there is a time to sow and a time to harvest. There is a time for new growth, a time for celebration, a time for winding down and a time for deep rest. Understanding the energy of the year that we are in can help us to harmonise with the natural flow of energies, instead of trying to swim against the current. When we do this, life starts to become much smoother and we achieve the best possible results with the least amount of effort. It can also minimise disappointment and frustration.

    This information can also be used to help us plan the timing of projects, moving house or changing jobs. Proper timing of our planned ventures can make an enormous difference to their outcome.

    Each of us is born in a 5 Core Earth year, which is at the centre of the 9 Star Ki sytem.
