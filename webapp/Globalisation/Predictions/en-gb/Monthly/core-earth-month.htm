<p>
    Core Earth months are associated with the energy of adolescence and we can often feel like one during this time. It is an unpredictale time and there may well be ups and downs and feelings of uncertainty.

    There may well be many different opportunities to explore and it may be difficult to decide what to do or where to go. It is important for us to try to stay grounded and centred. The support of others can be immensely helpful during a 5 month.
