    This month represents late evening or autumn
</h5>
<p>
    7 Metal is associated with the harvest and this is a month for us to relax and unwind, as well as to socialise and have fun.
</p>
<p>
    We often feel more carefree and adventurous during a 7 month, with a sense of quiet, inner confidence.
</p>
<p>
    This can also be a very good time to spend some quiet time alone to reflect.
