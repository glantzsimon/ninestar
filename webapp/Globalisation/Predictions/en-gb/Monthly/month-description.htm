    In addition to the yearly cycles that each our lives move through, there are also monthly cycles. Each year has the energy of on of the nine Energies and influences our lives in powerful ways.

    People who are in touch with Nature and her cycles understand the seasonal changes that occur throughout the year. There is a time to sow and a time to harvest. There is a time for new growth, a time for celebration and a time for winding down and resting. Similarly, the nine-year cycles that each of our lives pass through have a seasonal nature to them. Understanding the energy of the year that we are in can help us to harmonise with the natural flow of energies and stop trying to swim against the current. When we do this, life starts to become much more effortless and we achieve the best possible results with the least amount of effort.
