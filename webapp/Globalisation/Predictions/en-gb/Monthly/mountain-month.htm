    This month represents early winter or nightfall
</h5>
<p>
    During a Mountain month, we often have a sense of uncertainty and may feel the need to retreat into our cave. We are more withdrawn and uncommunicative than usual. 
</p>
<p>
    This can be a time of change and it is important not to be too impulsive.
</p>
<p>
    It can be very hepful for us to make an extra effort to connect with others during this time, so as not to become overly isolated. We should seek the support of friends and loved ones if need be.
