    This month represents night and winter. We can often feel introverted and withdrawn
</h5>
<p>
    During a Water month, we often feel quite quiet, cautious, introverted and even vulnerable at times.
</p>
<p>
    We may also find it more challenging to communicate with others during this month. This may lead to feelings of isolation and being left out.
</p>
<p>
    This is a time when we are more likely to find ourselves in states of deep reflection and introspection. It is an auspicious time to focus on spiritual practices, such as meditation, yoga, Tai Chi and to enjoy Nature walks. It's also a great time to get plenty of rest and recharge one's batteries.
