    The seedling is beginning to mature.

    This is the year in which we come into the energy of "adolescence"; of defining who we are. It is a challenging time, often characterised by difficult choices, ups and downs and much uncertainty. It is not uncommon for many old, unresolved issues to resurface during this time.

    Everyone is born in a 5 year and. Anything started during a 5 year will have a great impact on the following 8 years.

    Stay centred and true to who you are.
