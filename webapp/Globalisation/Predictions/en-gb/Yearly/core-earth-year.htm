    The seedling is beginning to mature.

    Everyone is born in a 5 year and returns to it at the age of nine, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, etc. This is the centre of the 9 Star Ki cycle and represents the beginning and end of a cycle. Anything started during a 5 year will have a great impact on the following 8 years and so should be considered carefully.
</p>
<p>
    As the stars are positioned exactly as they were during the year of our birth, we can experience a kind of "rebirth" during this time. Equally, there can often be an energy of "adolescence"; of experimenting with many different activities or ideas and defining who we are. It is a challenging and unpredictable time, often characterised by difficult choices, ups and downs and much uncertainty.
</p>
<p>
    It is not uncommon for many old, unresolved issues to resurface during a 5 Earth year. This can be a golden opportunity to get clarity and closure so that we can heal and move on.
</p>
<p>
    This is also a house of extremes. Therefore, if we have planned well and made wise decisions in the previous years, then things could start to come to fruition. Conversely, we can really start to suffer the consequences of our past poor judgment. 
</p>
<p>
    During this year we are right at the centre of the system, which means all the other numbers are focussed in our direction. People will naturally gravitate towards us for support or advice. This can feel overwhelming at times and we must be careful it doesn't deplete us.
</p>
<p>
    It is not uncommon for relationships, friendships or contracts to come to and end during this time, freeing up space and energy for new ventures.
</p>
<p>
    Although it may be difficult to decide what to do during this time, it is wise to try to stay centred, calm and true to who we are. If people around us appear to be asking a lot of us, we can protect ourselves by keeping a certain detachment, whilst remaining compassionate to their feelings and needs.
</p>
<p>
    This is an excellent year to take a step back and reflect. It is not an auspicious time to make long journeys or move home.
</p>

<p>
    Water and Tree people are most likely to feel discomfort when they occupy this house, as their Energies are in a Challenging Transformation with the Earth element.

    Health

<p>
    The most important factor during a 5 Earth year is our emotional wellbeing, which we would do well to pay particular attention to. It is also wise to avoid extremes of any kind. Moderation is key.
</p>
<p>
    As mentioned above, old issues can resurface during this year, including unresolved health issues, which may appear to be exacerbated.
