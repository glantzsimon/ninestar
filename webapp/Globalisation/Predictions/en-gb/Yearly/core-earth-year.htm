    The seedling is beginning to mature.

    This is the year in which we come into the energy of "adolescence"; of experimenting with many different activities or ideas and defining who we are. It is a challenging and unpredictable time, often characterised by difficult choices, ups and downs and much uncertainty. It is not uncommon for many old, unresolved issues to resurface during this time.

    During this year we are right at the centre of the systema and a lot of energy is directed our way. This can feel overwhelming at times.

    Everyone is born in a 5 year and. Anything started during a 5 year will have a great impact on the following 8 years.

    Although it may be difficult to decide what to do during this time, it is wise to try to stay centred and true to who we are.
