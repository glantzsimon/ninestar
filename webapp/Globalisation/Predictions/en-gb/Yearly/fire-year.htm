<h5>
    This is the year we take the spotlight
</h5>
<p>
    This year represents the full force of summer or the midday sun. It brings illumination, heat and clarity.
</p>
<p>
    This year is our time to shine. We will be noticed, for good or bad reasons. We may find ourselves making significant achievements and we will likely feel very energetic, enthusiastic and optimistic with a great sense of adventure.
</p>
<p>
    This is also a year when things we would rather keep a secret may well end up being revealed to the world.
</p>
<p>
    During a Fire year, people typically feel a great sense of clarity and may experience heightened intuition. We also typically feel much more sociable and communicative. We may well make many new friends. However, it is also common to lose some friends also.
</p>
<p>
    This is a very auspicious time to promote ourselves and advance in our careers or in some other area that we are interested in.
</p>
<p>
    A fire needs a solid hearth and plenty of fuel to burn. If we have made solid plans during the previous years of the cycle that have now come to fruition, then this House will be a bright, enjoyable period with plenty of opportunity.

<p>
    Metal and Water people may well feel some discomfort when they occupy this house, as their Energies are in a Challenging Transformation with the Fire element.

    Care needs to be taken not to burn out during this year. Even though we can have a lot of energy in this House, we can easily use it all up if we are not careful.
    
    In Chinese medicine, the Fire element controls the heart and small intestine. We need to make sure we eat a healthy balanced diet that is not to oily or spicy and avoid stressful situations. Relaxation, joy and feeling love and connection with others are some of the most powerful ways to nourish the heart energy.
