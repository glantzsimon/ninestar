<h5>
    This is the year we take the spotlight
</h5>
<p>
    This year is our time to shine. We will be noticed, for good or bad reasons. We may find ourselves making significant achievements and we will likely feel very energetic, enthusiastic and optimistic with a great sense of adventure.
</p>
<p>
    This is also a year when things we would rather keep a secret may well end up being revealed to the world.
</p>
<p>
    During a Fire year, people typically feel a great sense of clarity and may experience heightened intuition. We also typically feel much more sociable and communicative.
</p>
<p>
    This is a very auspicious time to promote ourselves and advance in our careers or in some other area that we are interested in.
