<h5>
    The fruits are beginning to ripen
</h5>
<p>
    This is the year we begin to see the fruits of our labour; the reward of all the effort put in during the previous years. It is a time when we feel confident with a strong sense of direction and purpose.
</p>
<p>
    This is also a year when we begin to get much greater clarity and understanding. We feel bolder and better able to express our needs and set healthy boundaries with people.
</p>
<p>
    Care must be taken not become overbearing or intolerant of others during this time.
