<h5>
    The fruits are beginning to ripen
</h5>
<p>
    This is the year we begin to see the fruits of our labour; the reward of all the effort put in during the previous years. It is a time when we feel confident with a strong sense of direction and purpose.
</p>
<p>
    This is also a year when we begin to get much greater clarity and understanding. We feel bolder and better able to express our needs and set healthy boundaries with people. Care must be taken not become overbearing or intolerant of others, however.
</p>
<p>
    Our health is usually good durinng this time and we have lots of stamina; however, we need to make sure we don't overdo it.
