    The harvest is in. It's time to celebrate and put one's feet up
</h5>
<p>
    This year represents late autumn or evening. It is the time to enjoy the harvest and to celebrate our achievements; a time to relax and be grateful for the abundance we have created for ourselves. It is also a time to reflect on the previous cycle.

    This is perhaps the smoothest and most enjoyable House to occupy. It is a great time to become more sociable and broaden our horizons. We often feel more attracted to others in this House and may well find romance; however, encounters may be superficial and short-lived. Care should be taken not to becoming overly focussed on intimate relationships.

    There can be a risk of becoming overly hedonistic and overindulging during this year, and later paying the price for doing so. To balance this, it can be a great time to also develop our spiritual side.

    Conversely, this House can also be an excellent time to release ourselves from the responsibility of the previous years of the cycle and to put our feet up. It is an excellent time for reflection and introspection.

    Many people find that money flows more easily to them during this time, perhaps because business ventures have come to fruition or sometimes money comes from unexpected sources, such as an inheritance or from the lottery.

<p>
    There is a risk that misunderstandings may occur. We need to be mindful of being clear in our communication with others.

    Water and Tree people may feel less at ease in this House than the other elements, as their Energies are in a Challenging Transformation with the Earth element.

    Health

<p>
    Our health is typically quite solid during this year and we enjoy more energy and stamina. In Chinese medicine, the Metal element controls the lungs and large intestine. If either of these organs gets weak, it can lead to feelings of depression, isolation and melancholy.
