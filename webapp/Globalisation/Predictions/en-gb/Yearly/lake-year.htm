    The harvest is in. It's time to celebrate and put one's feet up

    This is the year to enjoy the harvest and celebrate our achievements. It's a time to relax and be grateful for the abundance we have created for ourselves.

    Many people find that money flows more easily to them during this time. It is also a great time for romance; however, care should be taken not to becoming overly focussed on intimate relationships or to become overly hedonistic.

    This is also a great year to develop our spiritual side.
