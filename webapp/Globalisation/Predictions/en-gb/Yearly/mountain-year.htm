    The harvest is over. Winter is nigh.

    This is a time we tend to retreat into our "cave". We often feel withdrawn, reserved and uncommunicative. It is a time for honest intropsection.
</p>
<p>
    It is possible to feel a bit bogged down and stuck during this time. We may also feel rather more rigid and stubborn, even pushy about certain things.

    During this year, there may be a strong sense of the "calm before the storm", as during the following year we emerge into the spotlight of Fire Energy, which often leads to a change of direction.
</p>
<p>
    We need to be loving, kind and patient with ourselves during this year.
