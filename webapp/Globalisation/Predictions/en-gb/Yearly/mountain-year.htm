    The harvest is over. Winter is nigh.

<p>
    This year represents the transition from evening to night or autumn to winter. It is a time when Nature returns to stillness. We go indoors to shelter from the outside.
</p>
<p>
    This is a time we tend to retreat into our "cave". We often feel withdrawn, reserved and uncommunicative. It is a time for deep, honest intropsection.  However, we need to be mindful that we don't become too withdrawn, as this could be upsetting to those who are close to us and isn't healthy for us either. We need to make an effort to come out of our shell from time to time and reconnect with our loved ones.
</p>
<p>
    This can also be an uncomfortable time in which we feel stagnant, bogged down or blocked. It is helpful for us to simply take our time and move slowly and steadily and not to pressure ourselves in any way.
</p>
<p>
    We may also feel rather more rigid and stubborn; even pushy about certain things. We may be more easily misunderstood and so we need to make an effort to express ourselves more clearly. And, communication goes both ways, so we need to remember to listen carefully also. Failure to do this may lead to more conflict.

    We are typically more vulnerable in this House and need to be careful that we don't get into accidents, especially ones caused by others.

    During this year, there may be a strong sense of the "calm before the storm", as during the following year we emerge into the spotlight of Fire Energy, which often leads to a change of direction. This can make us feel uneasy at times. However, sometimes there are radical changes within this year too, brought on either by our own internal relfection or by external forces. This can be a good thing, provided that these changes are in alignment with our dreams.
</p>
<p>
    We need to be loving, kind and patient with ourselves during this year.

    Water and Tree people are most likely to feel discomfort when they occupy this house, as their Energies are in a Challenging Transformation with the Earth element.

    As there is often a strong sense of stagnation during this time, it is important to make an effor to stay active. We need to be especially mindful of our circulation and lymphatic system.
