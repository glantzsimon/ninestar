    This year represents the transition from winter to spring. There may be a sense of light at the end of the tunnel.

    Socially and financially this is a time of slow or little growth. Rather, this is the perfect time to start planning and figuring out the details of what we have been dreaming about in the previous year; to get everything in order ready for the arrival of spring and a cycle of new growth. It's also a great time for clearing out the old, in preparation for the new. Inadequate planning and preparation during this phase can slow us down in the next year.

    It is common to feel cautious, reserved and hesitant during this year and even lonely and isolated at times. We need to make an extra effort to reach out and connect with friends and family.

<p>
    We may be especially prone to worry during this year, especially about others. We may also be more anxious and cynical during this time. If these emotions do arise, it's good to simply remind ourselves that it's quite normal during this period and that we don't need to give them too much attention.

<p>
    It is also natural to feel a certain degree of stagnation in our energy during this time. It is not an auspicious time for taking action. It is much better to be patient and to conserve one's energy. It's also a good idea to share our visions and ideas with others and to be receptive to others' feedback.

    Water and Tree people are most likely to feel discomfort when they occupy this House, as their Energies are in a Challenging Transformation with the Earth element.

    In Chinese medicine, the Earth element governs the stomach, the pancreas and the spleen, and the health of the lymphatic system. Therefore it is import for us to move to keep our circulation healthy, otherwise the lymphatic systme can become stagnant. Dry brushing, rebounding and hot and cold showers are some examples of simple things we can do to keep our lymphatic system healthy during this time. However, most of all, it's good to move.
