    The seedling has sprouted, breaking through the top layer of soil with a tremendous burst of energy.

    This year represents early spring or dawn and therefore new growth, development as well as new opportunities. There is a sense of rising energy.

<p>
    It is the time to put our plans into action and begin working on our projects and endeavours. We are full of enthusiasm and have plenty of bright new ideas. It is also a great time to travel.

    Having the full force of spring behind us can bring tremendous good luck. However, it is wise to be sensitive to the fact that others who occupy different houses may not share our energy, enthusiasm and good fortune. We don't want to rub our success in their faces. However, our optimism can equally rub off on others and inspire them.
</p>
<p>
    We are feeling creative, energetic, confident and expressive. However, with such a huge influx of spring energy comes a risk of feeling ungrounded and even frustrated and angry at times.
</p>
<p>
    We often make very fast progress during this year. However, it is wise not to be impulsive or to rush anything and care should be taken not to overlook any important details. We need to stay focussed. We also need to make sure we take time to rest as well as to reflect on where we are headed and if we are still feel that we are on the right track.

    As this is such an energetic and active houses (Yang), it is important to balance it with more Yin activities. Yoga, meditation, Tai Chi, massage, Nature walks are all great ways to slow down and relax.

    Metal and Earth people are most likely to feel discomfort when they occupy this house, as their Energies are in a Challenging Transformation with the Tree element.

    With so much energy and movement comes an increased risk of accidents. It is wise to take care to avoid these wherever possible. 
    In Chinese medicine, the Tree element governs the liver and gallbladder. To support these organs, we should avoid eating late at night as well as overeating. Any imbalance in these organs is often associated with increased feelings of anger or frustration. Again, it is good to frequently take time out to slow down and catch one's breath.
