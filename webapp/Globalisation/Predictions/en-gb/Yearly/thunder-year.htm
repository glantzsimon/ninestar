    This year is the time to start new projects and endeavours. We are full of enthusiasm and have plenty of bright new ideas.

    This is the time when we are feeling most creative, energetic, confident and expressive.

It is wise not to rush anything and care should be taken not to overlook any important details. We also need to make sure we take time to rest.
