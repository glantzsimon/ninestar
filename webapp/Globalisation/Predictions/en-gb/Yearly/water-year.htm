    It's cold, dark and still. The seed is in the ground.

    This is a time for hibernation, deep rest and reflection. A time for pondering what one wishes to create during the next 9 year cycle.

    During this year, it is common to feel withdrawn and uncommunicative. Others may appear to keep their distance and we may feel vulnerable and even fearful at times.

    This is not the time for starting new projects and endeavours. It is a time for dreaming. A time for slowing down, resting and recharing one's batteries.

<p>
    Opportunities, ideas and inspiration come when we are still.
