    Not only does each person have a 9 Star Ki profile, which is determined by their date of birth, but in addition, each of our lives passes through nine yearly cycles. Each year brings the energy of one of the nine Energies and influences our lives in powerful ways.

    Another way to imagine it is that our lives go through seasonal changes, just like the spring, summer, autumn, winter; however, it is a nine-year cycle, rather than a yearly one. During the "summer" part of the cycle, we are closest to the sun and feel warmer, more energised and extroverted. Conversely, during the "winter" part of the cycle we are more likely to feel withdrawn, cool and introspective.

    People who are in touch with Nature and her cycles understand the seasonal changes that occur throughout the year. They know that there is a time to sow and a time to harvest. There is a time for new growth, a time for celebration, a time for winding down and a time for deep rest. Understanding the energy of the year that we are in can help us to harmonise with the natural flow of energies, instead of trying to swim against the current. When we do this, life starts to become much smoother and we achieve the best possible results with the least amount of effort. It can also minimise disappointment and frustration.

    This information can also be used to help us plan the timing of projects, moving house or changing jobs. Proper timing of our planned ventures can make an enormous difference to their outcome.

    Each of us is born in a 5 Core Earth year, which is at the centre of the 9 Star Ki sytem.

<h5>Drawing on our past experiences</h5>
<p>
    It is an interesting exercise to think back to specific times in our lives when important things occurred, such as moving house, changing jobs or difficult experiences. Also think about how you were feeling during particular years. Figure out the energy of the year when these events occurred and see if you can notice a pattern.

    It's also very elucidating to find out which year our partners, close friends or family members are in and to see if it sheds some light on our relationship with them. Depending on the year each of us are in, it could either create greater harmony or, conversely, it could make it harder for us to find common ground. For example, if our partner were in an 8 Mountain year and we were in a 3 Tree year, then we would likely be full of energy and new ideas, whereas our partner would be feeling withdrawn and quiet. This could be a potential source of conflict.
