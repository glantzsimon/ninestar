    On the surface, you may appear quite quiet and brooding. You are generally reliable and helpful. You can also be very influential and persuasive when inspired by something and have a strong desire to support that which you consider fair and just. You have great inner reserves for adventure and exploration. You are a deep, philosophical thinker. You may feel the need to retreat into solitude at times.
