    On the surface you may appear passionate and flamboyant or even impulsive and ostentatious at times. However, in relationships with others, you tend to be direct, clear and straight to the point. You are boundaried and could even be a little overbearing at times. You are a perfectionist and take pride in what you do. You are very sensitive to criticism and tend to take it quite badly. You crave your own space at times and may be a bit of a dreamer. You have enormous hidden strength and a great capacity for adventure.
