    On the surface, people tend to find you tactful and sensitive. You are quite helpful and supportive towards others and are reliable and fastidious in your work. Those who get to know you better may find you quite emotional. At times, you can be rather impulsive and unpredictable, changing your mind like the wind. You can also be quite stubborn about certain things. You have a deep and brooding quality and sometimes feel the need to retreat to solitude. You can also be very adventurous.
