    Outwardly, you appear sincere, straightforward, logical and well organised. You take great care in your work and your approach to life.

    You have a strong desire to support and help others and you can be tactful, sensitive and diplomatic when under pressure.

    However, those close to you may find you cautious at times, with a tendancy to procrastinate.

    You may also be shy or undisciplined at times. Conversely, you also have the potential to be fun and sociable.

    You prefer to learn from your own mistakes and may feel threatened by advice given by others.
