    You come across as sincere, straightforward, organised and logical, working with care and prudence. Your driving force is your desire to support and help others, and you can be tactful and diplomatic when under pressure. However, your character is primarily driven by Water. Those close to you will find you cautious, with the potential to procrastinate. This Water nature can make you shy or undisciplined, but equally gives you the potential to be fun and sociable.
