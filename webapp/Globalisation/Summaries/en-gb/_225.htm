    Your chart is entirely made up of Earth element. This gives you great consistency. You are essentially helpful, supportive, caring and diplomatic. You feel a great sense of fulfilment when you are serving others.

    You need to feel involved and appreciated, whether out in the world, at the work place or closer to home, within the local community and within the family.

    You may have a tendency to become overly fastidious in your work.

    Care should be taken not to become overly opinionated or obsessed with detail.

    You prefer to learn from your own mistakes and may feel threatened by advice given by others.
