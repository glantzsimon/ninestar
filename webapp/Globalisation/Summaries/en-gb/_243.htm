<p>
    Outwardly you are very energetic and full of enthusiasm.

    You are very expressive – often verbally – and spontaneous in your actions.

    Deep down you are trusting and open but you may be prone to ups and downs and may often need the support of others.

    Whilst you can act impulsively, your essential nature is consistent, helpful and supportive.

    You prefer to learn from your own mistakes and may feel threatened by advice given by others.
