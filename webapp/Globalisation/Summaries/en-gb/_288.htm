    Your chart is entirely made up of Earth element, which gives you great strength and consistency.

    In friendships and in business relationships you are reliable and keep your word.

    You are consistent, supportive and helpful.

    You can be fussy and even fanatical about detail. You can at times become withdrawn and uncommunicative.

    However, your quiter nature can change very quickly if you are provoked in any way.

    You are quite capable of delivering strong, compelling arguments when necessary.

    You prefer to learn from your own mistakes and may feel threatened by advice given by others.

    Overall, this is a very strong, reliable combination of the 9 energies.
