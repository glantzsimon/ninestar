    On the surface you can appear charming, easy-going and affectionate.

    However, those who know you more intimately are likely to see spontaneous outbursts of lively behaviour.

    You can also be impulsive and even a little self-centred, at times.

    However, you can equally be very fun-loving.

    You prefer to learn from your own mistakes and may feel threatened by advice given by others.

    You are essentilly consistent, helpful and supportive, with a strong independent side. Above all, you can be an inspiration to those around you.
