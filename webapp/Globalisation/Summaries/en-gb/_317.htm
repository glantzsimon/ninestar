    You have a lot of energy and vitality and are not afraid to take on plenty of hard work and commitments. You have hidden depths of emotion but these are typically only expressed to those close to you.

    You are empathetic, sensitive and flexible and you tend to take each day as it comes.

    You have a spontaneous and unpredictable quality to your character and may dislike making long-term plans and commitments.

    Outwardly you tend to appear quite sociable, laid-back and charming. You make others feel at ease by listening to them and acknowledging them.

    Most people would describe you as easy-going and independent, if a little unreliable.

    On the other hand, you can also be shy and reserved and sometimes feel the need to retreat and isolate from the wordl.

    In relationships you may initially be cautious, philosophical and shy; even a little secretive. It sometimes takes you a while before you feel comfortable sharing your deeper nature with people.
