    On the surface, you may appear reserved and tend to be tactful in the way you communicate. You are eager to make helpful suggestions or to lend a hand. At times you may seem fussy over the little details. When under pressure or to those who know you more intimately, another side of your character is revealed. You can be perfectionistic, proud and single-minded. Sometimes the way you communicate can be extremely frank and to-the-point. You tend not to take criticism well. You are not afraid of hard work and have the energy to take on projects and see them through. Your essential nature is energetic, creative, pioneering and determined.
