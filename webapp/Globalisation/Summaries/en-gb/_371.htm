    You possess tremendous energy, strength and vitality to take on tasks. You are not afraid of hard work and often break new ground in your career. Outwardly you may appear indecisive, quiet and even shy, withdrawn and cautious. You can be prone to procrastination. However, once you feel at ease with people, you may well reveal a witty, playful and fun-loving side. There is a deep reflective nature within you. You can be very creative and verbally expressive when inspired.
