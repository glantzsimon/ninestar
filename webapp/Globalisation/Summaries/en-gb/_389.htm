    You are extremely spontaneous with an enormous capacity to take on hard work. Your optimistic, energetic nature can be an inspiration to those around you. You can appear ostentatious or flamboyant and are not afraid to show off. However, you can also be impulsive and single-minded when you get a bee in your bonnet. Those who know you more intimately may find that you become uncommunicative, at times, needing to retreat into your cave to reflect. You have a deep sense of inner security. When provoked you can deliver a well thought-out and powerful argument.
