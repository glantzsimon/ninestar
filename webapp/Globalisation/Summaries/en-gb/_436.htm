    You appear to others to have a very direct and straightforward way of expression. You can be well organised, detail-minded and elegant in your presentation. Sometimes you are stubborn and overbearing. Although your principal quality is a steady, consistent, trusting nature, under pressure the explosive nature of Thunder will appear. With your back against the wall you will not hold back from free expression or sheer determination through hard work. If you do get into trouble you are very adept at talking your way out of it.
