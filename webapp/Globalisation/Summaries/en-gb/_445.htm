    You like to feel involved in situations at work or at home and are most comfortable when you take the lead.

    However, you should take care not to become too controlling obsessive.

    You are generally trusting of others and can bring your influence to bear the on situations in which you are involved.

    You generally have a steady, consistent nature. You are trusting and have a lot of common sense.

    You must avoid being too stubborn or too impulsive. Don't be afraid to ask for support.

    You have an enormous capacity to bounce back from difficulties through your strong will and determination.
