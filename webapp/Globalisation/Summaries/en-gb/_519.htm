    On the surface, you may appear impulsive or ostentatious. People are often drawn to your warm, charismatic nature, although you can, at times, be  ostentatious and showy. You tend to be quite intuitive and clear-sighted.

    Those close to you may sometimes find you cautious and philosophical or even withdrawn. You tend to have a broad perspective and can often see all sides of an issue. You may sometimes be a little secretive and do not share your immediate plans and schemes with others.

    Others naturally gravitate towards you for support, advice and inspiration. However, care must be taken not to overgive and exhaust yourself.

    You prefer to learn from your own mistakes and may feel threatened by advice given by others.

    Your fundamental nature is strong, consistent with an ambitious and materialistic streak. You like to feel involved and to be at the centre of what you do and are often the hub of activity, whether at home or at work.
