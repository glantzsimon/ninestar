    Your chart is entirely made up of Earth element, which gives you great strength and consistency.

    On the surface you may appear quite quiet and withdrawn. You may need to retreat to your cave from time to time. However, you can deliver a powerful argument when provoked.

    You tend to be very supportive and caring towards others, especially those close to you. You are diplomatic and straightforward. You can sometimes be overly fastidious in the way you work.

    Others naturally gravitate towards you for support, advice and inspiration. However, care must be taken not to overgive and exhaust yourself.

    You are very strong-willed and can be quite ambitious and possibly materialistic. You have a tremendous ability to bounce back from difficulties.
