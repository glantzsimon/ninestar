    Outwardly you have a fun, charming and easy-going nature. You are also quite independent and not afraid of hard work.

    Under pressure you can be extremely expressive, especially verbally, and potentially explosive.

    You like to be involved and at the centre of activities, whether with family, community or at work.

    You have incredible powers of self-preservation and the resilience to overcome challenges in your life.

    You can be ambitious and materialistic.

    Others naturally gravitate towards you for support, advice and inspiration. However, care must be taken not to overgive and exhaust yourself.

    You prefer to learn from your own mistakes and may feel threatened by advice given by others.
