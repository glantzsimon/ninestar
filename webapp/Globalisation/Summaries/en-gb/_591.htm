    On first impression, you may at times appear shy, cautious or indecisive. However, this is not your deeper nature.

    Those close to you would describe you as spontaneous and even a little impulsive. You often inspire those around you with your warm, affectionate and lively nature. You are very intuitive and it is very hard to pull the wool over your eyes.

    Others naturally gravitate towards you for support, advice and inspiration. However, care must be taken not to overgive and exhaust yourself.

    You possess enormous strength and willpower and can be extremely ambitious. You may also have a materialistic side. At times you can be self-centred and like to be at the centre of your work and family.
