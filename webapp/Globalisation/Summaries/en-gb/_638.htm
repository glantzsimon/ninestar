    You may appear outwardly reserved or quiet. You sometimes feel the need to retreat to your cave.

    However, when provoked, you can deliver a powerful argument.

    Your deeper nature, which is revealed under pressure or to those who know you more intimately, is strong, energetic, persistent and hard-working. You can be very expressive and potentially explosive under duress.

    Your fundamental nature is bold and moral and you express your opinions clearly and dirctly. 
    
    You have great leadership potential.
