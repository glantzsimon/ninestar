    Outwardly, you often appear easy-going, fun and independent. You are charming and know how to make people feel at ease.

    When under pressure and with those you know more intimately, you sometimes reveal a more changeable and emotional side. You sometimes have mood swings and can be stubborn and impulsive.

    You are quite trusting. Equally, many trust you and you can be persuasive when you want to be.

    You have a direct, bold and moral nature and have an enormous potential for leadership.
