    Outwardly you appear organised, logical and straightforward in your dealings. You can be extremely direct in your communication and are not afraid to voice your opinions.

    You have rather refined and elegant taste, which you express in the clothes you wear and the articles you buy for your home.

    You can be highly moral and even and care should be taken not to be overly harsh and judgmental.

    You have a bold, consistent and naturally authoritative nature with enormous potential for leadership.

    At times you may stubborn and overbearing and those close to you may even find you egotistical and demanding.

    You have a strong will and a need to feel in control.
