    You have great potential for leadership, which comes naturally to you.

    There is a lot of determination and boldness to your character, whilst at the same time you can be very logical and diligent in your actions. You need to feel involved, whether at work, at home or out in the community.

    You are quietly self-critical and highly perfectionistic. it is important for you to do things properly or not at all. You don't take criticism well.
    
    You like to take the lead need to be take care not not to become too domineering or obsessive.
