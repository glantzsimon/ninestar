    On the surface you often appear energetic, enthusiastic and spontaneous. You can be very expressive, especially verbally.

    Sometimes you can be withdrawn, uncommunicative and deeply private. Those who know you well will appreciate your need to retreat into your cave from time to time, especially when under pressure or uspet. However, when provoked, you can deliver a powerful argument.

    You can be very moral and noble and are direct and to-the-point in your communication.

    You have a strong, consistent nature and your 6 Metal principal Energy gives you great leadership potential.
