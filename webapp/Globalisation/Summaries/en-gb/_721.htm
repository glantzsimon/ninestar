    On first impression you may appear shy or cautious and are most at ease with close friends or family.

    You have a deep reflective nature but can be prone to procrastination.

    Those who know you well would describe you as supportive, helpful and tactful. You sensitive to others' needs and have a deep sense of justice. You may, at times, be overly fastidious and detail-obsessed.

    You know how to relax and enjoy putting your feet up. Care must be taken not to become lazy, however.

    You are stylish and appreciate the finer things in life. You may well appear younger than your biological age.

    However, your essential nature is steady, laid-back and charming, with a natural gift for making those around you feel at ease.
