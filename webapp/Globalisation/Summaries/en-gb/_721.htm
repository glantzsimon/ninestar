    On first impression you may appear shy or cautious and are most at ease with close friends or family.

    You have a deep reflective nature but can be prone to procrastination.

    Those who know you well would describe you as supportive, helpful and tactful. You sensitive to others' needs and have a deep sense of justice. You may, at times, be overly fastidious and detail-obsessed.

    However, your essential nature is steady, laid-back and charming, with a natural gift for making those around you feel at ease.
