    You may be a bit of a loner and could appear quiet or withdrawn at times. However, when provoked, you are not afraid to express your opinion and can deliver a strong and well thought-out argument.

    You are at ease sharing your ideas, both publically and privately.

    You are independent and have a quiet, deep determination. You can also be quite stubborn at times.

    Your deeper character is essentially trusting and open. You can also bring out this quality in others.

    You know how to relax and enjoy putting your feel up. Care must be taken not to become lazy, however.

    You are stylish and appreciate the finer things in life. You may well appear younger than your biological age.

    You can be quite persuasive when you want. At times you may experience swings in your nature and need to watch out for being overly impulsive.
