    You have a deep, reflective quality to your character and may appear shy or reserved to the outside world.

    You are strong-willed and single-minded with plenty of enthusiasm.

    You are not afraid of hard work and can often be quite pioneering in your field.

    You have a strong sense of of fair play and justice.

    Those close to you will likely find you cautious and rather philosophical at times.

    You prefer to learn from your own mistakes and may feel threatened by advice given by others.
