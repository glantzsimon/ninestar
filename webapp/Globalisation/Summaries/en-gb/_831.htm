    On the surface you can appear shy, quiet and cautious. 
    
    You can be indecisive and hesitant. However, you also possess great strength and willpower along with a tremendous ability to overcome life's challenges.

    You can be single-minded when committed to a cause and are certainly not afraid of hard work.
    
    Under pressure you can be very expressive to the point of explosiveness.

    You prefer to learn from your own mistakes and may feel threatened by advice given by others.
