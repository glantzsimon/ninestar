    Outwardly you can appear withdrawn or uncommunicative. However, when provoked you can be very expressive and are not afraid to voice your opinion.
    
    Your deeper nature can be bold, assertive and even demanding at times.
    
    You have a tremendous potential for overcoming difficulties in our life and bounce back quickly. This is especially true as you get older.
    
    Care should be taken not to be overly controlling and domineering. 
    
    You prefer to learn from your own mistakes and may feel threatened by advice given by others.
