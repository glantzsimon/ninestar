    You may appear helpful, gentle and quiet. However, when provoked you can be fiery, stubborn and self-centred.

    You are reliable and keep your word. You have great reserves of hidden strength and can be extremely determined and single-minded.
    
    You prefer to learn from your own mistakes and may feel threatened by advice given by others.
    
    Your strength and energy can be an inspiration to those around you, but care should be taken not to be overly impulsive.
