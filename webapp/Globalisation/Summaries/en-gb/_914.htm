    You have quite a charming and kind nature and are capable of influencing others with your ideas.

    You have an adaptable nature and are generally trusting and open.

    Those who know you well will sometimes find you cautious when under pressure, when you can withdraw and isolate yourself.

    You are driven by your principal Fire element, which bestows you with great sensitivity, intuition and brilliance. You can be spontaneous, lively, bubbly and warm-hearted and are capable of inspiring those around you. You also have great leadership potential. However, be careful not to be overly impulsive.

    It is important for you to get recognition and appreciation from others, otherwise you can lose confidence. Care must be taken not to be overly vein or self-centred.
