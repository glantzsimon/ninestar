    Outwardly you appear very energetic and enthusiastic and can be quite spontaneous. You have lots of bright, new ideas and are not afraid to express yourself. You are also not afraid of hard work.

    Your deeper nature is helpful, supportive and trusting. You can be tactful and diplomatic.

    Your fundamental nature is Fire, which gives you great strength, brilliance, clarity and sensitivity. You may well have strokes of genius, at times and can inspire others.

    You need acknowledgement from others, otherwise you can lose confidence. Care must be taken not to be overly vain or self-centred.
