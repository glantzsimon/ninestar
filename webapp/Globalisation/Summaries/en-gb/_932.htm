    On the surface you can appear reserved. You are often tactful and diplomatic in your dealins with others.

    You can also be fastidious and fussy over the details.

    You are hard-working and can be be extremely expressive and even explosive when under pressure or provoked.

    You are driven by your principal Fire element, which bestows you with great sensitivity, intuition and brilliance. You can be spontaneous, lively, bubbly and warm-hearted and are capable of inspiring those around you. You also have great leadership potential. However, be careful not to be overly impulsive.

    You need acknowledgement from others, otherwise you can lose confidence. Care must be taken not to be overly vein or self-centred.
