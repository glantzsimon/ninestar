    You can appear quiet and determined on the surface. You tend to have quite strong opinions can become argumentative when provoked or challenged.

    You tend to be clear and precise with a strong perfectionist streak. You do not take criticism well.

    You have great potential for leadership and are especially concerned with justice and fairness. You are not afraid to express your opinion and can be quite frank and straight-to-the-point. Your sincere manner can a little overbearing at times.
    
    Your natural tendency is to learn through life's experiences rather than academically or through the advice of others.

    You are driven by your principal Fire element, which bestows you with great intuition and brilliance. You can be spontaneous and lively at times, inspiring those around you.

    Care must be taken not to be overly self-centred or self-righteous.
