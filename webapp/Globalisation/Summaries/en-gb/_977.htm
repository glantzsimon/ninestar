    Outwardly, you can be very charismatic, entertaining and witty, and have the potential for a great sense of humour. 
    
    You have a deep inner sense of security and are generally very easy-going.

    You are not afraid to speak your mind and others benefit from your accumulated wisdom and experiences.

    You are driven by your principal Fire element, which bestows you with great sensitivity, intuition and brilliance. You can be spontaneous and lively at times, inspiring those around you.

    Care must be taken not to be overly vein or self-centred.
