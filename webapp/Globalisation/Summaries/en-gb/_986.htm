    You have great potential for leadership and are especially concerned with justice and fairness. You are not afraid to express your opinion and can be quite frank and straight-to-the-point. Your sincere manner can a little overbearing at times. 
    
    At times you can be withdrawn and feel the need to retreat to your cave. You tend to have quite strong opinions and can express a powerful argument when provoked or challenged. 
    
    You are driven by your principal Fire element, which bestows you with great sensitivity, intuition and brilliance. You can be spontaneous and lively at times, inspiring those around you.

    Care must be taken not to be overly vein or self-centred.
