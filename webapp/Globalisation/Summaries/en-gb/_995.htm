    You like to feel involved, whether in family, work or community matters.

    However, be careful not to be overly controlling or domineering.
    
    You are driven by your principal Fire element, which bestows you with great sensitivity, intuition and brilliance. You can be spontaneous, lively, bubbly and warm-hearted and are capable of inspiring those around you. You also have great leadership potential. However, be careful not to be overly impulsive.

    It is important for you to get recognition and appreciation from others, otherwise you can lose confidence. Care must be taken not to be overly vain or self-centred.
