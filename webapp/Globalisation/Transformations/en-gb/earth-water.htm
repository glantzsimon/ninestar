Water people, with their deep, flowing, exploratory nature, can sometimes become undisciplined, chaotic and too thinly spread. Without a container, they can lack direction and purpose.

However, too much Earth element can be overly restrictive and rigid, thwarting Water's natural flexible, exploratory nature.
