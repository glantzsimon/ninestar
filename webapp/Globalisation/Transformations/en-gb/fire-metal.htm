Metal people tend to be pragmatic, critical and clear and generally have a broad perspective and lots of common sense. However, they can also become overly rigid and stuck in one particular point of view. Fire Energies, who benefit from the perspective of the midday sun, often have a clearer, more balanced perspective than Metal Energies, as well as a warm, dynamic quality to them which is particularly good at gently melting and softening the rigidity of Metal people.
