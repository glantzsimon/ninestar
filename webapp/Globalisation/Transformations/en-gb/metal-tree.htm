    Tree people are highly creative, forward-thinking individuals and can be quite pioneering. However, many of their ideas require a great deal of refinement before they are of use. Metal people, with their broad perspective, common sense and critical eye are especially good at seeing the potential pitfalls in the ideas brought forward by Tree people. When this interaction works in a balanced way, the results can be spectacular (one might think of a beautifully pruned tree).

    However, when exposed to a very strong expression of the Metal element or if exposed over a long period of time, Tree's natural creative powers may be stifled, leading to anger and frustration. Metal’s critical input, though valuable, must be delivered with care so as not to cut down the Tree’s enthusiasm. In ideal partnerships, Metal helps shape the Tree’s potential into something lasting and strong, while Tree brings inspiration and renewal to Metal’s structured world.
