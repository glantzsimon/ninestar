Tree people are highly creative, forward-thinking individuals and can be quite pioneering. However, many of their ideas require a great deal of refinement before they are of use. Metal people, with their broad perspective, common sense and critical eye are especially good at seeing the potential pitfalls in the ideas brought forward by Tree people. When this interaction works in a balanced way, the results can be spectacular (one might think of a beautifully pruned tree). However, when exposed to too much or too agressive Metal element, Tree's natural creative powers may be stifled, leading to anger and frustration.
