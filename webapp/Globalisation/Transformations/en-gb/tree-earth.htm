Tree people love change and are constantly creating new solutions and ideas, which they pursue with passion. This can be extremely disruptive to Earth people, who tend to dislike change not instigated by others. Earth people can feel pushed by Tree people. One can easily invisage a vigorous young sappling breaking up the Earth in the spring time, as it begins its growth upwards. However, when out of balance, Earth people tend to get a bit stuck and stagnate and so the fresh, enthusiastic input of the Tree element is often the perfect remedy to get the Earth person unstuck.
