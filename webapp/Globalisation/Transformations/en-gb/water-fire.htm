The Water element runs deep and loves to explore the emotional world, flowing endlessly from one vantage point to the next. Fire people, on the other hand, are more comfortable with the perspective of the midday sun, where everything is illuminated and in plain view. What can therefore happen, is that Fire people can feel rather 'lost' in the world of Water people. They don't have much common ground and it can result in their flame going out. Water people also typically react to Fire's clearly defined opinions and perpsectives on situations, as well as what they view to be right and wrong or appropriate and not. To Water people, the opinions of Fires can sometimes appear harsh, judgmental, narrow-minded and lacking in empathy and they can feel compelled to draw their attention to the deeper, subtler, more diffuse layers of a situation, which can cause Fires to feel confused and misunderstood. However, when Fire people are out of balance, they can indeed become overly critical and narrow-minded and in those situations, the input of Water element brings balance, by injecting a much welcome dose of empathy and emotional sensitivity.
