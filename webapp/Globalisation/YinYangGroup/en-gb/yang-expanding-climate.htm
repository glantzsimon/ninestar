By contrast, people in the 'contracting' group (1, 6, 7, 8) usually feel more comfortable in cooler climates and during more inward or subdued times of the cycle, such as autumn, winter, new moon, or under low-light conditions. Their preferences tend toward denser, saltier, more solid and warming foods—such as baked dishes, hearty stews, root vegetables, and proteins. Yang types tend to feel more energized and balanced when the external energy is quieter and more inward-focused.
