People belonging to the 'expanding' group (2, 3, 4, 9) tend to feel most comfortable in warmer climates and during periods of high energy and light, such as spring and summer or when the energies are more expansive. These individuals often prefer lighter, more fluid and fresh foods—such as fruits, juices, soups, and plant-based dishes. Sweets and foods with high water content are generally more appealing to them. They are often more active, uplifted, and expressive in warm environments or during energetic peaks of the cycle.
