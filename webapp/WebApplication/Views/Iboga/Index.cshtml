					Pygmies have used iboga for over 65,000 years before it was discovered in the west.
					Now, due to over-consumption without any policy of sustainable management, this sacred plant will disappear from the public domain within 5 years

					<p>
						Iboga has been sold in western world since 1901.
						Today, more and more advertising touts iboga as a “miracle cure” without any apparent regard as to the sustainability of the resource.
						Bought with gold, Iboga is then sold on the Internet in violation of laws protecting it, without equitable sharing of its benefits and a risk of consumers who have no certainty as to its origin and quality.
						The price of iboga has increased by over 1000% in 15 years making this fundamental Gabonese medicine too expensive for locals to buy.
						In what can only be described as biopiracy, more than a dozen patents have been filed regarding the therapeutic use of iboga and its chemical derivatives in total disregard of the Nagoya Protocol protecting the people behind this plant and knowledge.

						The ivory trade and iboga trafficking are interlinked. Elephants love iboga fruit and the poachers track and kill them near the last wild reservations of iboga.
						Once they have murdered the elephants, the poachers also take all the iboga found on site.
						With your support, Blessings Of The Forest is committed to planting 10,000 feet of iboga wood in Akanda National Park in Gabon, for the benefit of the local people and also international research.
						Blessings Of The Forest is committed to building a bridge between traditional Gabonese healers and researchers worldwide. We offer humanity the most sacred knowledge of the art of healing using one of the most sacred plants of our common historic origins.
